  "text":"I was really excited about getting this hair dye and using it but sadly it was a GIGANTIC disappointment \ud83d\ude2d<br \/><br \/>1.) On the bottle, in the item description, etc it says that the color lasts for 45 washes but I can promise you that it does NOT last that long heck it barely even lasted 10% as long as it claims to (and yes that's even with me only washing my hair in cold water, only washing my hair once a week, using color protecting products, etc). Within only 4 washes the color has drastically faded and there's even some spots where the color has completely washed out already leaving bleach blonde patches. There's a few semi\/demi hair dyes i've used that will still stay pretty even when fading but unfortunately this isn't one of them- it's not ugly per say but it's really bland, lifeless and has me wanting to rush to the store to buy some more hair dye so I can fix it ASAP. I never thought in a million years i'd ever find a semi\/demi hair dye that was worse then Splat when it came to fading but man this dye takes the cake- with me taking care of my colored hair properly Splat will last me 10 washes before it gets to the \"ew ugly it faded I need to do a touch up\" stage whereas once again this only lasted 4 washes.<br \/><br \/>2.) This color isn't teal in fact it's more of a dark blue with teal highlights\/shine that you can only see if you're outside or standing directly under a light inside. I bleached my hair beforehand getting it 100% bleach blonde because I wanted it to be as bright as possible and even with that it still came out dark (and even while fading it looks blue have yet to see any green). I can't speak for anyone else but a genuine teal color is the unicorn of hair dye in my world- i've been dying and cutting my own hair pretty much only using semi\/demi hair dye for over 10 years now and in all that time I have yet to find a genuine teal color. I've pretty much tried every brand I could get my hands on with zero luck- it's either dark blue with teal highlights\/shine like this one, 98% green with 2% blue, green, dark green, blue, etc. I know going to a salon is an option and is probably my best bet to get genuine teal but because of my failings for the last decade i'm terrified of spending a couple hundred dollars just to end up with a non teal color again \ud83d\ude23. What in the world is going on? \ud83e\udd23 It's not the olden days where getting colors is impossible and we had to make our own colors using rare to find items it's 2022 so surely there's a way to get a GENUINE TEAL hair dye!<br \/><br \/>3.) I can't speak for anyone else but in my experience this is hands down the thickest hair dye i've ever come across. This wouldn't of been an issue for me had the bottle design been the same as a lot of other semi\/demi hair dyes are (a short easily accessible resealable cylinder) but since it wasn't and instead was put into a thick, dark and non flexible bottle it was next to impossible to get all the dye out or even see how much was in there. To get it out you either have to mix in some really watery hair conditioner or cut the bottle open and hope you don't hurt yourself or get dye all over the place in the process. While the design is visually really cute it's not practical- you end up wasting a lot of dye because you can't get it all out, in an attempt to get the remaining dye out you have to risk injuring yourself or getting dye all over the place or diluting it, since the bottle is black you have no idea how much dye is in there when you first get it so you won't know if you've been ripped off or not after getting a lot out you'll have no idea how much is still in there, because the dye is so thick and it's badly designed you end up having to constantly hit the bottom of the bottle\/squeeze on it really hard\/shake it hard etc just to get it out which after 20+ minutes really hurt my hands, you can't use the dye right out of the container like you can with the other cylinder hair dye containers and finally because you can't store any left over dye- the opening is so darn tiny there's no way you'll be able to get this thick dye back inside to use later on.<br \/><br \/>4.) This cost me $12.99 plus tax per bottle (it took 4 bottles to do my hair because I have really long thick hair) and when I bought it the price didn't bother me in fact it's pretty much average as far as semi\/demi hair dye goes (the cheapest hair dye I use costs $10 a piece and the most expensive I use is $15 a piece so this is right in the middle) but after taking into account that it's not a genuine teal color, how insanely quickly it fades, how unpractical the design is, that I can't store unused dye, how much ends up going to waste and all the other negatives the price is definitely not worth it to me.<br \/><br \/>5.) If you've used semi\/demi hair dye as much as I have then you already know about the notorious staining and bleeding that comes with these types of hair dyes haha but FYI this one is worse then what you're used to. With every other semi\/demi hair dye i've used by the second wash the bleeding stops, the staining on my skin and ears has gone away, it doesn't stain my skin and ears while wet, scratching my scalp doesn't result in stained fingers and dye under my nails and my fingers won't get stained while I wash my hair but with this dye all those negatives have continued all the way past the 4th wash. Basically this dye has all the negatives of semi\/demi hair dye but NONE of the positives \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f<br \/><br \/>So all in all I really don't like this hair dye and wouldn't recommend it. Tbh the only thing it has going for it is that it does make my hair feel really soft and doesn't leave a weird coating on my hair like some other semi\/demi hair dyes do but that doesn't mean much when everything else was a fail. Now that I think about it though I think this dye would be perfect for people who either only want crazy colored hair for a short period of time (like for a halloween costume, cosplay, an event, etc) or for parents whose kid's want to dye their hair a crazy color because it fades really quickly and isn't bright at all and is pretty mellow for semi\/demi dye, as for vets like me who actually want long lasting bright color STAY AWAY \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude02",

  "text":"If I could give this less than one star I would.<br \/>I set this up following the instructions closely. I live more in the country, I know where the underground lines are, the phone and electric run close to each other strait out of my yard, there are no other buried lines or anything else that could cause issues with the system as I had read. I had to purchase an additional spool of line and used nearly all of it.<br \/>We worked with my then 6 month old white lab to teach him his boundary with he flags and all. This seemed to work well for the first several months. Then I noticed he would not play when he was outside and the collar was on him (we only put the collar on him when he was outside) He would not play he would automatically sit on our deck in the same spot every time. After some more time he seemed to be erratic about where he would go, He would appear spastic in his walking around the yard, changing directions very frequently so it would appear as if he was zig-zaging across the yard for no apparent rhyme or reason.<br \/> At this point we got worried about the dog, but he would always be fine when he was inside, would play and act normal. Finally it got to the point when we would put him outside with the collar on he would walk around the yard for a moment and sooner or later (usually sooner) he would end up running to the neighbors yard, end up playing with their kids or their puppy. I passed it off as him being a curious puppy wanting to play. I would retrieve him, he would run again. Finally it got to a point where he would simply not want to go outside, and when he would he'd run almost everytime right away and even if the neighbors weren't home he'd just sit on their front step. The last time this happened I was extremely frustrated not understanding what was going on, frustrated at the dog and myself trying to figure out how I was failing in training this beautiful dog our family loved.<br \/>When I was walking him back we neared the line to enter our yard, I took off the collar so I didn't shock my pup. My hearing isn't so good so I don't normally hear the collar chirp when it nears the line even when I was with my pup. This time I listened to it, it chirped as expected nearing and crossing the line. I was planning on putting my dog inside so I didn't bother putting it back on him I just carried it in my hand. Our yard is large about 50 yards wide at the most narrow point and the front yard is about 80 yards deep until the house. I was walking about in the middle of the yard with my dog on a leash, the pet safe collar in my hand when I heard it start to chirp. I couldn't believe it. I put my pup inside and walked all over my yard and over to my neighbors house. To my horror the collar would do the shock chirp randomly in my yard. There was no rhyme or reason, no consistency of any kind in placement or timing. It would go off anywhere in the front or the back yard in the middle of the yard, near the house, and of course also by the perimeter. In my neighbors yard it would not go off at all, my neighbors house where my pup would run to is close to 80 yards away.<br \/>My dog has been turned into a fun loving playful dog that loved to play fetch outside to a dog that is afraid to go outside and this product has essentially trained him his only safe spot is the neighbors house.",

I was able to slug my way through, but am now resentful of the time spent that I will never get back.  First of all, this book rambles about a lot of nothing.  it might have been a great description of a pear (yawn) but that would have been better left as a short story. Also, some reviews have said it was a moving story of the Holocaust.  I thought there were a couple of scenes that depicted the absolute brutality of the &#34;Horrors,&#34; but, I felt like they were both perfunctory and obligatory.  The thing that annoyed me most (spoiler alert!) were the deaths of Erasmus and Mendelssohn.  Were they really necessary?  I mean, rabies?  Really?  Was it to show that something that is so innocent and happy as a dog could become mad and murderous?  I don't know. If so, i thought it gratuitous.  Truthfully, the best part of the book are the last 13 pages &#34;Games for Gustav.&#34;  I was moved more by those brief lines than entire rest of the book.  Maybe he should have made it a Flip Book so I could have started there first.<br \/><br \/>If you want some really good fiction about the Holocaust, try the Book Thief by Markus Zusak.

  "text":"I stopped reading this book after 16 chapters, roughly 20% through, because Nothing Happens.<br \/><br \/>The author does this baffling thing where he jumps between three different time-lines in the story. We go between &#34;Last Night&#34; &#34;Two Days Ago&#34; and &#34;Ten Years Ago.&#34;<br \/><br \/>Three or four chapters are spent with two characters whining as they dig up a grave. Whose grave? I don't know, we've not been told yet. Why are they digging up the grave? &#34;To send a message&#34;. That's all we know.<br \/><br \/>Several chapters are spent with the main character and his old cellmate as they meet another character. We actually get to see the Main Character and his Cellmate in jail, just before they break out. Do we get to see the breakout? No; the chapter actually ends just before they break out, and then picks up a week later.<br \/><br \/>More chapters are spent ten years ago, introducing the main character and the main antagonist back in college. We see them interacting, we see the rival's girlfriend, we see them selecting a thesis, we see them trying to gain superpowers in not-very-exciting ways.<br \/><br \/>We don't even learn what the main character's superpowers ARE until roughly chapter 14.<br \/><br \/>I've finished 1\/5th of this book and I am bored out of my mind. For a book with superpowered characters, we don't see them actually using them to do anything. We don't learn about the setting. We learn barely anything about the characters - all the main character shows us is that he's A) Smart, B) hates his parents, C) secretly hates his best friend\/rival, and D) regrets his course of action. We know next to nothing about the other characters, and they do so little to actually define their characters.",

Have been working with 2009 for a few months and continue to be incredibly frustrated and features that I loved that are missing from 2009 - too many to detail here and continuing to find more. The lack of ability to customize defaults properly is an ongoing frustration. Also, for some reason, reports selectively do not include my husband, although everyone else's spouses seem to be there. He appears in certain reports and not others. Trying to import the books I had saved in earlier versions has been a disaster.<br \/><br \/>I want to add another major change\/problem in this version. Genealogy Register Reports no longer show spouses of childless marriages! Previous versions did show information, including facts and notes on all spouses. In FTM 2009, if a person has had multiple marriages but children from only one marriage, ALL spouses are mentioned by name. But if you have no children with your current spouse, or are a newlywed, or have a gay partner, your spouses are no longer mentioned in the reports.

But I was looking to get a can of something \"better\" for a cheap gun frame. Idk about the durability or quality of this paint because the can and nozzle don't work. Followed all directions on can exactly. Here's what happens. Can starts off spraying with some sputtering for a few seconds then it sprays a nice beautiful mist, then the mist randomly starts getting thicker and sputters out again ruining my frame. Well it ruined what I was trying to do, the frame is soaking in a stripper right now. The can was shaken for no less than 5 min. Can was warm when applying as per directions. It's just worthless. If I wanted a short cut a can of krylon would have done me better.<br \/><br \/>Update: I have a lot of junk laying around and decided to try this on some stuff that I don't care about. What I noticed throughout the process is that using 220 micro grit paper to prep the surface is essential for the strongest bond. Normally with duracoat or kylon I use a 400 and it's perfect for a strong bond. With this stuff it is not. That being said, krylon is still stronger in my opinion. I oven cured the brownells for 2 hours at about 180-200 degrees on each surface prepped with different grits. Let all sit for 2 days then scratch tested them. On all of them the scratches were tearing of flakes of paint. I do not have this issue with kryon.  The other big issue was the lack of consistency with the spray. As it went on really uneven and had these splatters and splotches. I still have that issue but in the process of oven curing, it smoothed out a little bit. Still not as good as cheaper options. So i still conclude that your should just use krylon.  Do all your normal prep; sand, degrease by cleaning then low temp in oven to draw out more oil then hit with brake cleaner, paint with matte krylon (dries really fast between coats), oven cure for a few hours or air cure for a few days, finish with fast drying krylon matte clear coat. I promise you will have a better result than this over priced stuff.",

His hatred of the Jewish GD is vicious.  He spends hours talking about Hindu myths, evolution, Darwin, and the ancient pagan religions including the Greek heros.  All of this is logical to him, but the Torah, the Jewish God and the Kabbalah are completely nixed as fabrications and fables.  There is something odd about this hatred.  Not Good.  It take Susan Sarandon's constant intercession to keep the viewer alert to this neurotic and hyper Anti-Semite.  To those Jewish Movie Stars who admire him I suggest you look up someone who can explain why the Germans did what they did to the Jews, rather than Campbells focus which is what the Jews did to deserve this.

But if you like your reading material to be of superior quality to something you could have written yourself by 9th grade, I recommend taking a pass on this tepid tale. English is not the author's native tongue, although he has become comfortable enough with it to write a couple novels in English according to his bio. I'm not entirely sure if Hidden in Havana is one of them or if it was translated, but either way it fell short of my expectations for a work of fiction put out by a major publisher (or a minor one, or self pubbed for that matter).

  "text":"Having thoroughly enjoyed _The Great Bridge_, I sailed into this book with a pretty strong tailwind. In fact, I defended the book unread in a comment to a previously-written negative review. That reviewer had lamented the lack technical detail such as of first-party notes; I suggested that such notes might not have existed. And so shame on me for a review in advance. Won't happen again. According to Mr. McCullough, such notes did exist -- so where were they? My recollection of _Bridge_ is that the Roeblings: Did pioneering work on suspension bridge technology, particularly with regard to span stiffness; caisson work in deep water (learned the hard way); spinning-in-place of suspension bridge cables; statistical quality control (and how the unscrupulous tried to bypass it); and other developments that led to an extremely robust, fault-tolerant bridge, all lucidly explained in sufficient detail to hold the technocratic reader. The Wright Brothers: Rewrote (and corrected) the handbook of empirical aeronautics; developed and applied wing warping to impart a measure of self-correcting stability (arguably the key to the castle, from a technical perspective); developed (and\/or employed the guy who developed) an engine light enough to fly and the propellers that it drove; and... learned to fly. I suspect that it is the fatal flaw of the book as literature: That there is no way to make a compelling story about an internal development. Their late predecessors had grabbed the tiger by the tail and been mauled by it; they acquired skill unpowered and at a safe altitude and speed.<br \/><br \/>It may be that Mr. McCullough concluded that learning to fly was so pivotal that more details on the other achievements would detract from that part of the story more so than useless details about what their sister wore... and after demonstrating flight, the book petered off into etc., etc., etc.. Attend: No airplane (save some contemporary imitators) built since has looked anything like the Wright Flyers; _The Spirit of St Louis_, IIRC, had a Wright Whirlwind engine. How did this come to pass? That would, to me, at least, have been more interesting than much of what was included.<br \/><br \/>That is not to say that the book was not, on the whole, enjoyable; merely not as informative as it could have been in areas that I had expected would be its strength. The two star rating is for the fact that the book starts out with a series of poorly conjoined vignettes so boring that I would not have gotten through the book had it not been a reading group selection. Be advised that it does get better after the first chapter or two.",

  "text":"Sunset Magazine was a staple growing up. All my grandparents subscribed to it. They clipped recipes and affordable DYI projects that enhanced their lives. My parents liked Sunset for planning inexpensive car trips for our family and the excellent, in-depth articles on gardening and landscaping. Old issues were carefully stored and the associated books were bought with barely a preliminary review. You knew you were getting quality, well-researched information and ideas when you bought anything Sunset Magazine-related.<br \/><br \/>After the Lane Family sold Sunset to Time\/Life in the early 1990s, the focus changed. The warm editorial voice and trusted experts began to be pushed aside for more product tie-ins and a very regimented editorial calendar. The front of the issue took on the generic, a \u201cpotpourri\u201d of small articles and \u201cfinds!\u201d that had existed in other magazines. Sunset followed the art and editorial examples set by Martha Stewart, Coastal Living, and Better Home and Gardens. Sunset lost its unique West Coast voice and became far more generic.<br \/><br \/>When Katie Tamony took over as editor in the early aughts, the party was over. The garden sections was often reduced to 1 or 2 pages. Almost all of the garden and landscape articles served as publicly pieces for professional nurseries and landscape architects. There were precious few articles that reflected the burgeoning online gardening scene, with no coverage of how auction sites, craigslist, and online nursery sales were changing Western gardens. The Sunset Idea homes were outrageously priced and unattainable. Environmental advocacy and education stories appeared once a year-if at all. Stories were shortened, photos emphasized and insipid first person narratives (good lord - Joel Stein!) were prominently featured.<br \/><br \/>There was the late-to-the-game wine club, metal patio furniture from Asia (painted to look like wood) and a hyped up line of garden plants - all items that can and could come from any retailer. An updated Western Garden Book was put aside by many of my fellow gardeners, due to a lack of online resources, no propagation section and valued anchor plants missing. The garden calendar was barely updated and the recipes lacked the wonderful mixture of California and Pacific Rim cultures that are predominating in the West. Like every other magazine, we had a Letter \u201cpersonally\u201d from The Editor, an over-thought (but award winning!) Table of Contents, and a retail catalog of services, items and experiences we could purchase. The magazine of Western Living had become the magazine of Western Buying.<br \/><br \/>Another low was the addition of celebrities on the cover. Josie Maran, Kelly Slater, Malin Akerman - congratulations on having fine publicists. No matter how many celebs you put on the cover, Sunset, I\u2019m buying your magazine for substance. I\u2019ll get People or EW if I want froth and carefully constructed celebrity profiles.<br \/><br \/>The current nadir is the \u201ccould have been an Absolutely Fabulous episode\u201d remodel of the current editor\u2019s newly purchased home in the East Bay. Current editor Irene Edwards has taken the narcissism of Instagram, Facebook and the utterly vacuous Remodelista, added product links, and presented something so self-indulgent, so utterly lacking in educational value, so lacking in service to readers that I continue to share it with others as a cautionary tale of bad magazine editorial conception and direction.<br \/><br \/>In 2017, Sunset was spun off by Time, Inc. to a Beverly Hills-based investor, Michael Reinstein. In 2018, there are more DYI projects, the website has been cleaned up, and the focus on education and service appears to be coming back. Hopefully, the new owners will look at Make, Dwell, Pacific Horticulture, regional magazines and websites, along with the Lane-era Sunset to create a new publication that truly inspires us to better Western Living.",

  "text":"I bought this dishwasher a couple weeks ago and have run it about once a day since. First of all... on a basic level, it is just so, so great to not have to hand wash dishes anymore.<br \/><br \/>I did a lot of research before I bought this model. It turns out pretty much every countertop dishwasher is made by the same manufacturer in China; they\u2019re just branded differently and have slightly different controls.<br \/><br \/>I picked this one mostly for the two year warranty, which was way better than Danby\u2019s. I decided a better warranty was worth the extra 40 bucks or so.<br \/><br \/>Pros: It\u2019s easy to install and use. There\u2019s very little assembly before you\u2019re good to go and start running a load. It holds a surprising amount, actually... I wasn\u2019t expecting my 11-inch skillet to fit, but it does, as long as I don\u2019t try to pack too much other stuff in at the same time. It can also hold up to medium-size pots, full-size tongs, etc. Pretty much everything has come out clean the first time so far! I\u2019ve been using Seventh Generation detergent packs, and they seem to work well with this machine.<br \/><br \/>Cons: it\u2019s kind of slow. But all mini dishwashers are, as far as I can tell. It also takes up significant space in a small kitchen. (I have a truly tiny kitchen, so I mounted it on a rolling metal cart from Cleanitsupply, and that works great! I just roll it in front of the sink when it\u2019s time to do the dishes and roll it back out in to the dining room when it\u2019s done.)<br \/><br \/>A piece of advice: Check the connections on the back each time before you turn on the water! If you move the hoses AT ALL after the last use, they can come slightly loose, and that will cause a leak if you don\u2019t retighten them before you start the next wash.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: Well, I used this thing about 3-4x week for 2 years total before it stopped draining properly (infuriatingly, just after warranty ran out). It throws up an error code and beeps for a long time when it's not draining well. I kept it limping along for a while by doing this tipping trick the manufacturer told me about when I called, but the other day it crashed and burned... started leaking out the bottom and wouldn't drain at all. I cleaned the hoses and got it to drain tonight, but now it just whirs and beeps and won't work properly.<br \/><br \/>It was great while it lasted but I expected more out of an appliance that cost several hundred bucks. I took good care of it and followed the instructions, so I'm pretty disappointed that it crapped out so early in its life.",

  "text":"&#34;Dark Lightning&#34; is the fourth in Varley's self-described Heinlein Juvenile tribute novels and, according to Varley's website, probably the last of the series.  Which is a shame, because the Thunder and Lightning books deserve a better finale than &#34;Dark Lightning.&#34; Maybe Varley lost interest in the series or maybe &#34;Dark Lightning&#34; was written to fulfill a contractual obligation. Whatever happened, it's the weakest book of the series, and one of the weaker books of Varley's career.<br \/><br \/>There's very little good to say about the book. The plot is plodding, weak, and unbelievable. While it superficially parallels Heinlein's &#34;Orphans of the Sky.&#34; the storyline has nothing of the excitement of that 70-year-old book.  Similarly, while the two main characters are nods to the &#34;unheavenly twins&#34; from &#34;The Rolling Stones,&#34; unlike Castor and Pollux, Cassie and Polly are superficial, wooden, and not even particularly likeable. While I would have always had one hand on my wallet around Cas and Pol, I would enjoy their company.  Can't say the same about Polly or Cassie, who would seem to be most interested in whether I was giving the appropriate male attention to their butts.<br \/><br \/>If you haven't read the Thunder and Lightning series, please start with the first and best, &#34;Red Thunder,&#34; which *is* a wonderful homage not only to Heinlein, but also to the works of John D. MacDonald.  &#34;Red Lightning&#34; is almost as good and &#34;Rolling Thunder,&#34; while having issues, is still a great read. &#34;Dark Lightning&#34; isn't.  I wish it was, and, as I said at the beginning of this review, I really hope Varley reconsiders and writes the capstone book that the series deserves.  Certainly the conclusion of &#34;Dark Lightning,&#34; with its references to &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; and &#34;Tunnel in the Sky&#34; hint that Varley has the germ of a follow-up story in mind.  If we're lucky, maybe we'll get to see it.",

Sounds like a lot, but if you have 5 six minute blocks saved (3-5 tags) then you are running at half before it overwrites itself.<br \/>-add a rear camera as well.<br \/><br \/>All in all if you like having less wires and want something simple, this is a pretty good option.<br \/><br \/>If they had a front\/back version with 5x the capacity I\u2019d probably pick it up at a 300$ price tag.  They might here in a few years.",

Jesse Isenberg is a quirky Jewish man new to the West coast scene from Brooklyn.  The characters seemed stilted and not sure if that was a reference to the movies of the times or just what Mr. Allen wanted.  Kristen Stewart was not as stilted but sort of dreamy again possibly as an homage to 40's and 50's stars.  I liked this movie but not as much as other Woody Allen ones.",

  "text":"The leash is a thin tape (1\/2 an inch wide & as thick as a dime)on a retractable spring. It extends 26 feet, and self-retracts as the dog gets closer, or as you catch up to him. I was initially concerned the leash would break after being vigorously rubbed against trees, gates, walls, corners, etc, but it is strong material. Think of the stuff seat belts are made from, only thinner and narrower. This leash has been used for an 80-85 pound pit bull mix. It holds up just fine, even when he spots walking cheeseburgers (cats) in the vicinity and tries to sprint after them. I've dropped it a few times without any problems. I have several other leashes (a cord leash instead of a tape leash, a double leash for two dogs, and another tape leash) and this is the best. The other tape leash has failed after less than a month. This one has over 700 hours of use on it, and seems to have at least that much more. (roughly 6 months times 4-6 walks per day times 45-90 minutes per walk.)<br \/>  (edit: It's been almost 2 years since the 10-1-10 review. I have bought 2 of these (got another large dog) and both are still working fairly well. One of them was used as a chew toy by yet another dog; it damaged part of the handle, but the device still works. It just looks banged up now. I don't buy leashes to win fashion shows, I buy them to keep a dog within range of me when outside. The other one developed a small fray about 8 feet from the end. I trimmed it with some ordinary scissors, and that's that. Still works mostly fine. The one minor fault is that at times the cord doesn't retract fully. If I pull it out completely and let it feed back in, that sometimes works. Other times it clears up by itself. Not a big thing; I just like having the cord taut. I wouldn't deduct a point for this, so I'm leaving the original rating as is. If the (first) leash had 700 hours over that 6 months, it now has about 5 times that much, so 3,500 hours.<br \/>  I have noticed that on a shorter leash, the dogs walk a bit faster and stray less. They wander on lawns and up pathways more when they have the leeway this leash allows them (26 feet versus 8). That's okay, I want my dogs to have the most freedom possible and this helps allow that.)<br \/>  edit\/update: 9-3-16: After about 6 years, the leash is losing its struggle to maintain tautness. The cord will pull out and then either flop or slowly drag back partway, so that about 6 feet of cord still dangles outside the hand-unit. That doesn't help if I'm trying to keep my dog from going into the street if a car is close by, or from going up to a person if that person is (or appears to me to be) afraid of dogs. I'll try to figure out where and how to return these leashes, since I've heard there may be warranty issues. I'll update again when\/if I get repaired leashes or get blown off. For now, modified 5 stars down to 3.",

  "text":"The third collected volume of Brian Michael Bendis' New Avengers is nowhere near as good or enjoyable as the first two volumes.  In saying that, what we get here in Secrets & Lies isn't bad at all, it's just not as compelling as one would hope.  Secrets & Lies starts off in familiar territory with the New Avengers taking on Hydra who is trying to free the Silver Samurai, and leads up to Captain America recruiting a mysterious new member named Ronin.  As the TPB continues, Spider-Woman's secrets get revealed, as Cap learns the truth behind the return of her super powers, as well as just who she is working for.  The entire synopsis that you just read is actually more interesting than the actual events taking place here in Secrets & Lies, because Bendis just doesn't seem to be that into the story himself.  Ronin isn't that interesting of a character in my opinion, and the book focuses on too many single members (particularly Cap) than the group as a whole.  David Finch's artwork is his usual great stuff, as is the work by Frank Cho which is featured here as well.

It was tremendously educational as the author wove the story around the downfall of the &#34;Soviet Union&#34; Jack Ryan is president and coping with a radical leader in Russia. Jack Ryan Jr is in London and his work leads him on a wild journey into Russia's underworld. If I had one criticism it would be that it was a little to wordy with regard to educating the reader on Russia's current goals of annexing their surrounding territories. Although, the Ukraine is in the news and struggling.  Linda Beaulieu",

  "text":"This is actually a review for vols. I and II.  Just in general, Gould's style is fantastic for some of the sonatas but is really inappropriate for others.<br \/>His portamento (detached) presto\/prestissimo playing makes the \"Tempest\" sonata the best version I've ever heard but really makes the \"Pathetique\" seem rushed and totally without feeling.<br \/>I mostly bought vol. II for the last 3 sonatas (op. 109, 110 and 111).  I figured the most unusual and most \"un-Beethovanic\" of the sonatas deserved the most unusual interpretation, and I wasn't disappointed.  They are clear and with good \"diction\", fast where appropriate but also slow and legato where melodic and flowing.  Even in the most technically difficult sections Gould, in typical contrapunctal style, weaves the different voices in and out of the melody holding to his philosophy that \"Every voice is important\".<br \/>Probably the most disappointing of all the recordings on these 2 sets is the \"Appassionata\".  Playing it through at practice speed does nothing for the passion, depth and beauty of this piece and only serves to exemplify Gould's hatred for it.  (Typically, if Gould hated a piece, he would play it through either blindingly fast and without regard for dynamics or lethargically slow to heighten its inferiority and \"boringness\".<br \/>The \"moonlight\" seems a little fast, esp. the first movement, but it might be Gould's literal interpretation of 2\/2 time.  The 3rd movement is at breakneck speed that some people might like.<br \/>I actually prefer the romantic-style playing of R. Serkin, Brendel and Horowicz for this piece.<br \/>Listen to the 2nd movement of the #13 where the left and right hands are playing parallel arpeggios.  In the 1st section the notes are played together but in the second section the hands are staggered by an 8th (the left hand plays the note 1\/8th before the right).  I have never heard a piano make that kind of ethereal echoing sound and, I suppose, it probably cannot be reproduced without the kind of fast detached playing that only Gould could do.<br \/>So, no one recording artist has the best performance of all the Beethoven sonatas.  With Gould, you'll get excellent interpretations of some of the lesser known works and less adherence to the romantic style of the better known \"named\" sonatas.",

It's always looked like a very beautiful, enchanting game. This particular one though has horrible graphics - very blocky, old-school. Which I guess makes sense considering it was released in 1999, but unfortunately the trailer for this game makes it seem like it has the beautiful, enchanting graphics that I was expecting. Do yourself a favor and don't believe the trailer - check out gameplay videos instead before you decide if this is something you want to spend your money on.",

  "text":"I hate this keyboard. When it decides to work correctly it's easy enough to type on, and the size and depth of the keys is nice. More often than not though, I find myself having to type more slowly than if I had just used the stupid on screen keyboard. If I type a word and then hit the space bar, it will give me several spaces instead of just one, which of course adds a period over the previous word and capitalizes the next one. Not so good when every word ends up becoming a new sentence. The delete key also does this, so I might be trying to delete just one of those extra spaces and also end up deleting half of the previous word. Occasionally the punctuation keys have this problem as well, though not as often, and none of the letters or numbers have ever done this. This seems to happen mostly when I first open an app and start typing, and goes away if I persevere and keep typing through the first couple of minutes. It doesn't seem to be related to any one specific app either.<br \/><br \/>I like the case itself. It is quite heavy, but for my purposes that doesn't really matter. I wouldn't want to carry it in a purse though. It's nice that the top comes off of the keyboard. The hinge doesn't work as well anymore though. I've had it less than a year, and it now will only hold its position if it's all the way open or about halfway closed. I also learned not to pick it up by the top (the part that actually holds the iPad) when it's open. The keyboard part will fall off, making a lot of noise and scaring anyone who happens to be in the same building.<br \/><br \/>It seems like I have a lot of complaints, but for the most part the case and keyboard work well enough for my occasional use. If I ever find a keyboard that works better I will definitely be replacing this one, but until then I will just view it as an exercise in patience.",

  "text":"I saw one of these in a local pet store &, as a tropical fish nut, just had to get it for my American Eskimo puppy. They happened to have the glow-in-the-dark one. My Eskie loves it but only gets to play with \"Fishie\" during relatively brief, outside play sessions, because it won't stand up to continued chewing. (It's also great for outside because grass, dirt, etc rinses off instantly).  He's already chewed off the anal fin & the tips of the tail fin...the fish is made out of a rubbery plastic sort of material that I like because it's not hard on his baby teeth, but don't like because he can chew bits off. It's not easy, & the bits tend to come off slowly, starting with a crack, so I've been able to remove the pieces myself without him swallowing them. I dunno if they'd hurt him if he did --sorta soft, no sharp edges-- but don't want to take the chance.<br \/><br \/>He also loves to pounce into & just generally attack water (I made him a sort of baby pool out of a rubbermaid-type under-bed storage container), & he really had a great time leaping into the 'pool' to attack the floating fish. We've had some fun night-time play sessions due to the glow-in-the-dark aspect. The glow fades after a while but is renewed to a very bright glow after just a minute under a lamp.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line, I (&my dog) love this toy but wish it were sturdier. I'm sure really butch chewers like large dogs, bulls, chows, etc would bite thru them very quickly. Although my 4-month-old Eskie seems to have a bite like an alligator, I'm sure he doesn't compare with bigger jaws!

And Oliver found the male character, Jed\u2019s, sudden love for Nora a bit unrealistic especially because both of them are supposedly damaged and find trust difficult.<br \/>But for an enjoyable Friday evening read, Oliver gives this book 3.5 \ud83e\uddb4\u2019s and we will be reading the next one in the series!<br \/><br \/>Isn\u2019t my boy handsome though? \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udcd6\ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99",

I will get a set of pens like these, store them horizontally, and keep them wrapped until the time I actually use them- which was the case with my Lime Green. I bought this set in April- had no need to use my lime green until today. When I unwrapped and primed the pen, the paint did not absorb into the tip as all the others have done, but rather just laid on the surface of only one side of the tip. No matter how I tried or waited for the paint to permeate through the tip, it did not, it simply just \"blobbed\" down off the side of the tip. It was almost as if the tip had some sort of coating on it preventing the paint from reacting with it the way the others have.  Granted, I do have the rest of my set, and I love the colors, but am disappointed that I've lost one of the set due to a faulty tip.  Overall, I would still say purchase the set, but be wary that even when they have still been wrapped, if they are not used immediately, there may be issues",

The first thing that came to mind upon hearing this is that there was not enough passion for this project and if that was the case, it showed. The characters seemed very one dimensional. Ledger does show glimpses throughout the story of the deeper aspects of each of her primary characters. The problem is she stops short and never delves beyond that point. If she had taken one aspect of the story such as the chronic pain angle or Emily and Simon's faltering marriage or even the tragedy of losing their first born and focused on that instead of messily trying to link all these major themes together in one book, she probably would have written a much better story. There was just way too much going on in one novel, so much so that that it was painful to read. Emily is having an affair, her daughter is displaying completely contrary behavior toward her mother. Her husband is attempting to launch a new hobby both time consuming and expensive and which he knows nothing about while he is running a successful medical practice and also running an illict new drug trial for a medication he knows nothing about nor has bothered to research. The ending does not do any kind of job tying together the loose ends that are just left flapping in the breeze. Ledger really needed to finish this book before setting it loose on the world.",

  "text":"I purchased these masks since the 3M version is currently not available to the general public.  While I do like the material and the elastic cords that attach to your ears the mask has two fatal flaws.<br \/><br \/> The first being the metal nose piece that should comform to the bridge of your nose once bent, the material is too flimsy to form any kind of effective seal around your nose leading to air gaps in the mask.  This is pretty annoying since every time you exhale it blows into your eyes causing a slight tickle.<br \/><br \/>The second flaw seems to be the masks exhaust port which seems to serve little to no purpose.  On the interior of the exhaust port there is a plastic stopper that is supposed to keep the flap from opening too much but with this mask the stopper is firmly placed right against the flap not allowing it to open at all during exhale.  If I firmly seat the mask around my face bypassing the nose piece it is pretty difficult to exhale since the exhaust port is blocked.<br \/><br \/>I'm not really sure what to think of these masks and if they are a safe option, not just for working around the house but for any type of covid protection.

Now married and ensconced at Pemberly, they are the proud parents of Peter and Jayne Darcy, every parent\u2019s ideal offspring\u2014now young adults\u2014and the new generation entering society.<br \/><br \/>A chance encounter with a niece of the Darcy\u2019s brings Jeffrey Richards\u2019 name and eventually his person to Pemberley. A man of wealth as well as character, Jeffrey Richards has rescued the niece from an unsavory situation, and what ensues is a rollercoaster of romance, intrigue, and false impressions or rather, misperceptions.<br \/><br \/>This enjoyable read keeps the reader on her toes. Along the way we meet some honorable, some nasty, but always unforgettable characters: Gallant and honorable Jeffrey Richards, beautiful and wholesome Jayne, stately and unassuming Lady Elisabeth. We meet loyal servants like Mr. Grayson who cares only about his master\u2019s well-being; and decent servants like Mr. Pole and Mrs. Lawson who concern themselves with young Jeffrey\u2019s welfare. Then there are also despicable ones like Elspeth and Carmichael, and others, who are only interested in themselves.<br \/><br \/>A charming story with a very satisfying ending.

Charlie is an up and coming young adult who has just graduated high school and has the whole world in front of him when tragedy strikes.  The rest of the movie basically involves seeing how Charlie's life is altered and how he deals with his personal misfortune.  Efron, although relying on his eyes to do a lot of the acting, ultimately succeeds in gaining empathy for Charlie's unfortunate loss.<br \/><br \/>This a family film with a special message viewers of nearly all ages will enjoy.  The acting in other key roles is right on, including newcomer Charlie Tahan's depiction of Sam St Cloud and Amanda Crew's portrayal of the girl who captures Charlie St Cloud's heart.  The supporting characters are vividly brought to the screen by two of Hollywood's best: Ray Liotta and Kim Basinger.  Although professional critics didn't provide much praise for this flick, I think audiences will feel differently.<br \/><br \/>The screenplay is well formulated.  Due to various emotional events including love, loss, despair and (foruntately) true happiness taking place, I felt the pace of the movie was actually faster than the 1 hour and 49 minute run-time.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line: If you missed it in theaters, check out \"Charlie St Cloud\" on DVD.

Those who just wanted music wouldn't really call the last one too accessible. But this volume is accessible. I'll show you how.<br \/><br \/>1. Dead In Love I have a picture that they were playing somewhere in skelaton shirt and pants, until at the end they all play as actual skelatons and at the end of the video, it says Desert Sessions 1988-2003. THe music is all about the enoyment of a sadistic relationship that Jack and Sally couldn't even touch. The best I have ever heard so far on the album.<br \/><br \/>2. I Wanna Make It Witchu: I often found this little number cheesy, if not a sunny beginning. I say that this song seems a lot more accessible than Mark Lanegan's take on romantically strange songs on Desert Sessions 7&8 with \"Covousier\". I may eventually play it, but it ends up getting skipped by me.<br \/><br \/>3. Covered In Punks Blood: A Fight Club with Guitars. You getting dragged across a road that is and isn't finished by a trans-am. That is all you need to know.<br \/><br \/>4. There Will Never Be A Better Time: My 3rd  favorite song. This one has a certain frantic feel of the song as PJ Harvey takes place with her guitar and ghostly voice.<br \/><br \/>5. Crawl Home: The first single off of the album, which I would play sometimes. The video I saw for it was good but didn't really coincide with the song too much, but nonetheless, the song is a bit like it or not. Once you buy the CD you'll be able to tell which direction to go. But I say, I recommend it to PJ Harvey fans.<br \/><br \/>6. I'm Here For Your Daughter: At first, I was so confused because that song that got off to a wonderful start, especially with the guitars, was so friggin' short. But quantity aside, this is my personal favorite and the out-of-whck song that you'd love, too. (If I was allowed to, I would have given you the entire song easily, but I rather you figure it for yourself. It never killed me.) Can you believe this song was performed only twice live?<br \/><br \/>7. Powdered Wig Machine: Imagine you were in England the days of Mozart, wearing those powdered wigs waltzing to this song. Yep, same way. Kind of weird but very good to listen to after a while.<br \/><br \/>8. In My Head...Or Something: The song that most people at the Lullabies To Paralyze page were complaining about. After having listened to both versions, I say that this is a good song, but LOP's version is a lot better. I even mouthed the words on LOP to this song. But nonetheless, this song is a good listen.<br \/><br \/>9. Holey Dime: Very dark lyrics from this one. The personal lyric that kind of affected me a bit was \"sent to He11 on paper wings\/They're all laughing\/...A stitch in time and it's your turn to unravel.\" I'd be too lazy to say this song is about personal fascination with sadism. Alain Johannes outdid himself on this song.<br \/><br \/>10. A Girl Like Me: Polly Jean Harvey back to give us dark view and imagination on relationships. The song was too much on two listens but after having the CD for almost over a year, I evjoyed it.<br \/><br \/>11. Creosote: The fascination with Jingle-Jangle slide guitars is what got me to accept the beauty in blues music. Listen to this, and the jam will be a wonderful experience. You will feel as if you were actually watching the guitarist play the music.<br \/><br \/>12. Subcutaneous Phat: Josh's signature guitar slide comes in to hand you a funk-rock extravaganza from the makers of Desert Sessions.<br \/><br \/>13. Bring It Back Gentle: I wasn't into this song until yesterday. It's OK. The guitar jamming sesion in the middle made it worth my while.<br \/><br \/>14. Shephard's Pie: My 2nd personal favorite experience on the record with guitars and people cutting in to further add the cartoony exterior of animals coming in line to be served some shephard's pie. After that, are just commercials recommending you Rekords Rekords Records.<br \/><br \/>So there you have it. This CD seems a litle more accessible only because this CD has more music than spoken word interludes that filled the last album. Nonetheless, after you buy this, I suggest buying Vol. 7&8. And when you are done with that, I recommend checking out the rest of the Desert Sessions catalog to hear how it all started.",

  "text":"I was pleased to purchase season three and even more pleased to watch all fourteen hours in one sitting (leaving me late for work the next morning.)<br \/>The third season is all about growing up. I have read the reviews and I see people are upset by the \"dullness\" of the season when in reality it is the most exciting.<br \/>Season three shows every character growing and rounding out their characteristics and behaviors.<br \/>The character Brian begins to take a stand on what is important and though most people do not like him, I admit he and Melanie are my favorites.<br \/>Justin also takes a stand and this time he stands up to someone who hurts him. And as he says, \"Brian never made me promises, you did.\" I think people have been forgetting that broken promises can be as heartbreaking as anything else.<br \/>Melanie and Lindsay this season take a very interesting turn. Lindsay becomes much more dominant and Melanie seems to have a new respect for her partner that shows in her decision making.<br \/>Onto Ted and Emmit. I adore Ted's character (he is most like the gay men I know, insecure but wonderful.) His dark fall into the world of drugs should be seen as acting gold. And Emmit's support of a lover and his own heartbreak (and career moves) are thrilling. Though he does seem to play the abused housewife.<br \/>Michael and Ben. Oh, what to say. This relationship grows the most this season. We see a loving couple grapple with issues from work to home and overcome them all. I adore both characters and this season shows their personalities in sync.<br \/>One thing I miss and of course thank you womever for mentioning it... Michael and Brian's friendship has been pushed to just three or four scenes out of the entire season. I am hoping season four will pick their friendship back up.",

They have both suffered in different ways. The author has done an excellent job of making the characters believable and relatable. Their pasts imbue their present with such emotion, and the author does a good job portraying that. There's both humor and heaviness in this story. The only thing I didn't like about it was all the profanity. The books I grew up reading never or rarely had profanity, so it is always a jarring and bad surprise to come across it in books. In this one, the F-bomb was dropped right on page one, which in itself was nearly enough for me to stop reading, but I read the reviews that said how good this book was, so I stuck with it. It IS a good story, one that hits all the right emotional buttons.

Their personalities were quite different but they worked well in the narrative. I must also point out that the male character in all this was not the usual overly macho, alpha, jock stereotype.

Sound quality is on par compared to basic head units out there.<br \/>I ended up upgraded the amp to an aftermarket 100 watts X2 and better speakers in my vehicle which was a big improvement. I tried it first with stock speakers and the Atoto without the new amp, with the new amp only and then the new speakers and new amp. The amp was a big improvement not only in power but sound quality from top to bottom.<br \/>There is a faint scratchy sound from the Atoto after 5 minutes of listening which comes and goes. This also happened with just the Atoto and the stock speakers and no new amp. It also didn\u2019t happen with the original radio. Like many car head units, the EQ and DSP section is not the best. A lot of harsh digital artifacts in the sound when used.<br \/>All in all though, the sound quality is acceptable for a car.<br \/><br \/>A couple of features I don\u2019t like are:<br \/>The always changing colors for the screen and button. I haven\u2019t found any way to get it to stop. This is typically \u201cRETAIL MODE\u201d on other units. It is distracting.<br \/>The spectrum analyzer in the music app is strictly for show.

A young single mom and a man several years older raising his young niece who survived a car accident that killed both her parents have been supporting one another for a couple of years through the single parent\u2019s group they belong to and by sharing childcare duties for their children; she has made it clear she wants more, he is worried about looking like a dirty, old man but one night changes everything in more ways than one.<br \/><br \/>Caleb is use to being in charge due to his job as a lieutenant with the fire department, he is also super protective (honestly a bit overbearing) of his friends especially Lexi who he has vowed to himself is off limits due to their age difference and the fact he needs her in his life to share childcare taking duties with. Caleb as a hero drove me a little bit nuts in that he made assumptions about Lexi without ever talking to her and in fact even made some decisions (demands) about her living arrangements for her and her son when he found out what was going on in her life. He also kept some big news from her regarding his niece which disappointment me greatly. While Lexi may be young, she grew up fast when she became pregnant and no one who raises an infant while attending nursing school, and taking care of another child to boot is meek and weak, in fact Lexi is resilient, strong, and knows her mind and it shows when she lays out what she wants from Caleb in no uncertain terms.<br \/><br \/>With a two year old and a four year old around, these was a lot of laughter, a few interesting tantrums, but also a lot of love. Ms. Nicolas does a great job of keeping the kids\/family time from and center without sacrificing the romance between this couple. As they knew each other so well already, the relationship did move at a fast pace but most will agree it was a long time coming. Lexi had some specific demands that Caleb had to wrap his brain around which led to them knowing each other on a different level and Caleb understanding that while Lexi is quite a bit younger than him, she definitely knows her own mind.<br \/><br \/>As always author Erin Nicholas manages to mix hot and sexy with sweet and innocent making Nice and Easy a delight to read and an excellent addition to this series.<br \/><br \/>Review copy provided for a voluntary review.",

I can\u2019t tell you how truly effective these are at bleaching, because my teeth are light to begin with, but my I feel that the overall appearance is noticeably brighter and the surface of the teeth feels cleaner.<br \/><br \/>I truly love the toothbrush that comes with the kit! Even though I am a devout user of a sonic toothbrush, I\u2019ve been reaching for this one daily. The bristles are thick and comfortable, but I wish the handle were a little longer.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m not crazy about the cleaning powder. I like how my teeth look and feel after having used it, but it is so messy! I find it very annoying that the surface of my countertop is always covered in white powder whenever I open the container.

The second one is to remove the pin on both ends of the cover so that you can extend it when installing it into the brackets.  There is no mention of these pins in the directions.  If you do not remove them you cannot install the cover into the brackets.  You are welcome!<br \/><br \/>Other than that they were pretty easy to install. Took us like a hour and a half.

As a fan of Peter Green in his Mayall &amp; Mac days, &amp; being quite aware of his situation, I knew I wasn't going to be getting this disc to hear that tone out of his Les Paul that KNOCKED me out.<br \/>And I was right. But I also enjoyed this album considerably. No tone, no Les Paul, but this is a great disc if you really enjoy the acoustic blues like I do. It might be me, but this is some of the CLOSEST covers of Robert Johnson one will likely hear...anywhere. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I was blown away by the actual &quot;feel&quot; they achieved to the original recordings of Po' Robert in the 30's, which is a challenge in its own right.<br \/>I really don't know what Green played on these sessions, &amp; from what I hear, he enjoys playing the harp &amp; some guitar while Nigel Watson handled much of the soloing. But again, that isn't a bad thing. His voice has aged exceptionally well through the years (especially for the material they played).... &amp; it was just great to hear that Peter Green was back playing &amp; making music again. But make no mistake: the music is excellent on this album. Very ironic that Peter Green makes his way back, playing Robert Johnson songs...",

So if you enjoy many different kinds of music, this would be the magazine to get. But if you are very selective about  what you listen to, then you would be better subscribing to a magazine for specifically the type of music you like.

Lee is great as the mummy, brought back to life by the reading of a sacred scroll, and now controlled by a mysterious Egyptian who directs the mummy to go out and kill those responsible for desecrating the tomb of an Egyptian woman whom Lee loved in ancient Egypt.  One of the \"desecrators\" is, of course, Peter Cushing, who in one scene, attempts to blow away the bandaged beast with a shotgun (to no avail, of course!)

  "text":"Nowhere to Hide by Lindsay McKenna is a strong start to the Delos series.<br \/><br \/>In Nowhere to Hide, Lia and Cav both hurt from events in their past, and these events have shaped how their lives are today. Lia is scarred inside and out, and these scars rule her life. A life that is now in danger in Costa Rica. Cav is former SEAL working security whose mission right now is to keep Lia safe. An unexpected attraction is almost immediate, a need to get to know each other when they meet. Cav is very intrigued by Lia, and Lia finds herself beginning to trust him and feel comfort from him. Mixing business and pleasure can be difficult, but somehow Lia and Cav do just that. A romance slowly and steadily grows, just as the suspense and intrigue of the danger Lia is in grows. Will Lia feel safe enough to trust herself and Cav? Can Cav keep Lia safe so that they can leave the past where it belongs and take control of their future?<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed getting to know Lia and Cav. I liked these two characters. They are both strong, brave and caring. Their maturity and a lack of any angst made them really likable and believable. It was easy to feel for and with them as Lindsay wrote with smooth, easy to read flow. I liked watching their relationship grow, the bumps they need to maneuver over. The pace and the build up of trust between these two was believable. Cav is a very admirable hero! Patient, skilled, and very interested in Lia.<br \/><br \/>I liked that there are really two strong plots woven well together...Lia and Cav's relationship, and the heart stopping danger Lia is facing. In Nowhere to Hide, Lindsay writes well of dangers that are very real, issues that do happen.

But what I've found is that if I just set the volume up high on the headphones, I can simply adjust it down with my phone.  The headphones come with a rubber strap to sort of tighten the wire connecting the 2 sides, so that helps.  Very comfy overall.  I'm not a fan of the silicon style buds that typically come with IEMs, but the Sony ones aren't too bad.  I purchased a set of Comply TX400 memory foam tips, but I think they're slightly too large as sometimes one tip gets stuck in my ear.  I ordered a pair of the TX200s and will try them this weekend.<br \/><br \/>Sound Quality:  The one compromise I made with this purchase decision was that I knew I'd be dealing with lossy audio.  I primarily listen to Hi Res FLAC (16\/44 --&#62; 24\/192) and then Pandora and Spotify.  I have bluetooth speakers with AptX and I've been impressed with the codec in the past.  You can't really discern the artifacts and that metallic quality that typically accompany AAC\/MP3 files.  These headphones are pretty neutral and bass quality is pretty impressive (I don't mess with bass \/ treble controls if I don't have to).  More than anything, the sound is clean, not harsh, and the background is black (ie quiet).  Sony's done a good job.<br \/><br \/>Connectivity\/Bluetooth:<br \/><br \/>I use use these headphones with my Xperia Z2 phone and my late 2013 retina Macbook Pro 13 and both connect via aptX with no issues.  The range on these headphones is pretty good too!  I can walk around my room and there's no stuttering or cutouts.  Obviously, if you're listening to high bitrate audio and you walk far away from the source device, the connection speed is going to drop.  So there are limits.  I did have an issue one morning at the office where the headphones would connect to the Z2, start playing, and then cutout.  But I haven't been able to replicate the issue.  I tried having a phone conversation with these on and the person on the other line had to ask me to repeat myself a few times - so I think I need to read up on the specifics of using these for phone calls.  So I'll try to update once I check that out a little more.<br \/><br \/>Battery Life:<br \/><br \/>Can't really comment just yet, though the battery just died as I'm typing this.  But definitely these headphones last for several hours.  I've only charged them once since purchasing a week+ ago, so most likely they were due for charging.<br \/><br \/>Overall:<br \/><br \/>So far so good!  I think for $150, the Sony MDR-AS800BTs strike a great balance of sound quality and ease of use.  Yes, the button scheme isn't great, but that's a minor gripe when you get NFC + aptX.",

Doesn't feel cheaply made and well worth the price of the item.<br \/><br \/>I wanted a new heat gun for in my craft room after mine quit working. I like them to help with things like heating labels to be removed from craft materials, to dry paints faster or melting candle wax to combine them. This is able to do all that and more. It's way better than my previous \"craft\" heat guns in that it gets hotter alot faster and has alot more options of heat levels.<br \/>It only took a few seconds to heat up a label to remove from the back of glass tile. Im still learning the level and amount of time required for different crafts but this heat gun definitely goes above and beyond what I needed it for.<br \/><br \/>I'm excited to learn what else I can use this for now that I have it.

  "text":"I started out in the PDA world with the iPaq 3835 PocketPC because I liked the beautiful high-res screen and needed the Word\/Excel compatibility for work. I never really considered Palm having the heavy-duty workhorse model I needed.<br \/>My friend introduced the Tungsten T to me, and it has been a real eye-opener. He demonstrated that the included software, Documents To Go, actually supports Word and Excel BETTER than PocketPC. More formatting is supported and unsupported formatting is not lost between syncs with PC and PDA. It even supports the occasional Lotus spreadsheets that cross my desk.<br \/>The screen is absolutely superb, and offers even higher resolution than my iPaq, at 320x320 I get even more columns on the screen. It's also incredibly bright, I now keep the brightness level at a mere 25%. Good for battery life too.<br \/>Needless to say, after his demo I took the plunge 2 weeks ago and I haven't regretted it. Along with the above features have come improved stability. I had gotten used to the occasional glitches in ActiveSync syncing and intermittent resets with iPaq, thinking it comes with the territory. After all, my Microsoft Windows 98 PC setup does the same :-). Yet, my new Tungsten device has been absolutely stable from the start. Although I have to initiate the syncs myself, I gladly trade having to push a button for the stability I gained. It's also so tiny, this PDA is much more pocketable.<br \/>I also like the 5-way dial pad feature. It allows one-handed operation of the handheld, which makes address lookups etc. very quick and easy. My friend pointed me to a little app called NewPen which greatly reduces the need to bring down the slider for the graffiti pad...which brings me to another thing, the graffiti is very easy to learn and after 2 weeks I write faster using it rather than the somewhat flawed handwriting recognition on the iPaq.<br \/>The Bluetooth phone+PDA setup seems pretty nice too, but I'm still stuck with an old-era old phone for now.<br \/>It would be nice if it came with a bit more memory so I bought an 64Mb SD card, which I can also share with my digital camera.<br \/>Overall, I'm very happy with my new PDA. The Tungsten T is an incredible device, it has all the features and stability you could ask for. If you are in the market for a PDA and size, screen quality, word\/excel, and stability are important to you, then go buy it. You won't be dissappointed.",

That said if you monitor the kid they\u2019ll be fine. My only other complaint is a criticism of ALL play pens, they  should come with padding underneath (to protect baby from hitting the floor too hard) but none of them seem to, and this one is no exception.

Keep in mind that this is not a quick access safe. You're not going to be able to get it open if you're under stress (like being attacked). In the end, make sure you understand what this thing is supposed to be. If you need quick access, pick something different (and those are a lot more expensive).",

Not that it was a bad game(by any means). It was just there were moments in the game that were so insanely difficult that it left me cussing like a madman. Fortunately, I stuck it out and kept playing and it turned out to be an even better game than the first. Now, the third is upon us and I'm really impressed with it. You can play as both Dark Jak and Light Jack with new move sets, such as the ability to glide over great distances and more. There's an awesome arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods. Enemies fall with realistic ragdoll physics and that's not all. You get to drive a variety of vehicles, amongst other things. Sadly, this game concludes the story that began with The Precursor Legacy but it's good to see how the story ends. Naughty Dog made the series look even better with this one. Action\/Platformer fans are really going to love this one.<br \/><br \/>As of my writing this review, Naughty Dog has a PSP Daxter game planned, which I'm seriously looking forward to.

Perhaps it's a temperature thing.  Anyway, if you are looking at this review, you probably already know you want a slate cheese board, so go for it.  This one is exactly what it says it is. I raised the rating to 5 stars after a few months of use.  It really is nice, it hasn't broken, and I am OK using non-sharp knives on it.  So my only concerns are no longer issues.",

  "text":"I couldn't stop reading! I started this book at about 5pm and by 12:24am I was reading the last page, and take into consideration that I took about a 2 hour brake for dinner and a bit of tv.<br \/><br \/>This book just hit me really hard, it was so easy for me to get into Jesse's mind set, her problems, her fears and her pain, there were many similarities between us that at times I felt like I was reading my own journal.<br \/><br \/>This book centers around Jesse, she a track and field runner at her school, that was until she lost her Dad, now is the summer and all she wants is to get away from home, to give her mom time to grieve and to also give herself some time as well, so she becomes a counselor at a summer camp, but when she gets there she gets assigned to a cabin with 4 boys instead of girls, soon it becomes apparent that these boys are a handful.<br \/><br \/>The fact that this book takes place almost in its entirety at the camp, made every chapter go by fast, there were always things and activities and pranks going on that it made the book a very fast read, I gotta be honest and say that Jesse lasted longer than what I would've had, those boys were crazy!<br \/><br \/>Sometimes I really got frustrated with Jesse but then I remembered all the feelings that she was keeping and pain and that made me think twice about judging her or her actions.<br \/><br \/>There's a bit of romance in the book and it is quite cute and heartwarming but I think that the time Jesse spends in the camp was about so much more than just falling in love.",

  "text":"Much more so than the other two Anthology sets released by the Beatles, this set comes across as very deliberate and well-designed.  This is less a result of planning than the nature of the Beatles career.  CD one tracks their mastery of the pop art-form, while Disc 2 features their experimentation with the art-form and taking it further than anyone before them, and perhaps anyone since.  All the while, both discs echo each other, showing the consistency and creativity of the band itself.<br \/>The first &quot;Anthology&quot; tracks show their pop-mastery all too well.  While their early work was not significantly different than what other rock bands were producing, but this time, they had moved beyond their simple R&amp;B roots and found ways to infuse their work with a creative excellence which really perfected the pop genre.  Moreover, they are very dynamic songs.  The move from the pristine beauty of &quot;Yes It Is&quot; to the powerful drive of &quot;I'm Down&quot; and then back to delightful beauty of &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;.  What we hear in this set are the songs are presented in a more bare state than they would be released, but the genius comes through effortlessly.  This would be a focus of the set.  &quot;Yesterday&quot; without the strings is still absolutely perfect.  Likewise, Lennon's &quot;It's Only Love&quot; thrives without the strong guitar.  It is a wonderful way to experience these songs, with such a focus on the great vocals.  While all of this was going on, the more formulaic nature of the Beatles live shows offer a very different way of seeing the band.  Disc One again features a lot of the live tracks from these years, showing just how much the band had mastered live performance, often in spite of their audience.  The difference becomes all the more stark once we start to see the tracks from &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;.  The band was pushing pop music beyond what it was, but without abandoning the genre itself.  Some of the alternate takes are interesting, but not terribly powerful, but there are exceptions.  Notably, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; and the rehearsal of &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; offer a great look at some of the group's new works in a very different stage than we would come to know.  Compelling and fascinating, these tracks offer a glimpse at where the Beatles would go artistically following &quot;Revolver&quot; and on the second disc of this set.  Also, the strings only version of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; ought be mentioned, for it is a great reminder of how strong a producer and composer George Martin was.  While much of these discs show the unembellished masterpieces of the Beatles music, here we can really appreciated the embellished masterpiece of Beatles recordings.  These two purposes would be increasingly important after the Beatles abandon touring and concentrate on their studio work.<br \/>This duel focus is how Disc Two introduces itself, with three very different versions of the classic &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.  First is a demo version recording by John Lennon in his home.  The song is beautiful and the beauty isn't the least bit difficult to see in the barren demo recording.  From there we find a very different studio recording than would be eventually released.  Simple, but experimental, we can really get a picture of the song's nature as childhood remembrances.  Still, it was not what the composer wanted, so we also get treated to another later take on the song, which would be part of the final recording.  Familiar, yet new, we now experience the mastery of their recording in full.  Also, we hear an extended &quot;wild drum track&quot; from Ringo which does a lot to elevate him as a musician.  After a remixed version of Penny Lane, we move onto the recordings for &quot;Sgt. Pepper's...&quot;, the band's most highly regarded achievement artistically.  The version of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; found here is composed with the purpose of highlighting the creative work that went into putting this marvelous recording together.  Although artificial in nature, it is a fascinating way of presenting a historical look on the song while remaining an excellent track in its own right.  Later in the disc, the Reprise version of &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; is introduced in a much more powerful rendition than would find its way onto the album.  Also, the full version of the very experimental &quot;You Know My Name...&quot; is a real treat.  The rest of Disc Two is very strong and great to listen to.  &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; without George Martin's arrangement, a great demo of &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot;, and the fantastic early version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot;.  Disc Two has a host of great tracks that excel both as historical studies of the Beatles music and great versions of the songs in their own right.  It appeals to two different audiences, and makes this set a great pick-up for all Beatles fans.<br \/>As a last note, I do want to talk about the &quot;new&quot; track, &quot;Real Love&quot;.  This is really a masterpiece by all involved.  It is a beautiful song from John Lennon which is beautifully developed by the remaining members of the Beatles.  It is far superior to &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and really makes this play the infamous &quot;What if...&quot; game.  The band works together so well and so effortlessly, they cannot be considered anything less than the most artistically accomplished band in the history of Rock n' Roll.",

I had ONE of these treats in my pocket earlier when we went for a trail ride and my gelding would not stop trying to get it. I love that they're small and you can fit them easily in your pocket. They come in 3 shapes. A leaf, a sunflower, and a hibiscus. About the size of a quarter, maybe a bit bigger. Even my dogs like them. You do get quite a few in here. The treats are in a plastic bag inside the box. I would definitely repurchase since our horses are obsessed with them. This would also make a great gift for any horse owners in your life!",
