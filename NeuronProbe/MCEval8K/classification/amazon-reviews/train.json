I suspect it's a defect in the way ours were put together as there'd never be so many positive reviews if this were common, but I've had to throw ours out.<br \/><br \/>There's a silicone (?) flexible tube that connects the sipper-part on top to the underside of the lid; it makes the tunnel that water passes through when you drink. It looks like the silicon piece is supposed to make a water-tight seal with the plastic lid, allowing water to flow and the inside of the tube to be cleaned. The outside diameter of the tube should stay 100% dry (and so woudn't need cleaning). In ours, mildew formed outside of the tube. A skinny bottle-brush cleans inside the tube, but the lid has to be disassembled (in a way that customers clearly aren't supposed to have to do) to clean outside of the tube.

I strongly believe that there is no justification for Salinger for writing this book when his entire vocabulary consists of all of three words, all of which are obscenities, and one of which is consistently and irritatingly misspelled. Because I was assigned to complete the reading of this book, and will surely forfeit credit if I ignore this responsibility, I will continue to suffer through it and will labor under the hope that something miraculous will occur, causing the book to take a turn for the tolerable, and the pain to cease.",

I was able to slug my way through, but am now resentful of the time spent that I will never get back.  First of all, this book rambles about a lot of nothing.  it might have been a great description of a pear (yawn) but that would have been better left as a short story. Also, some reviews have said it was a moving story of the Holocaust.  I thought there were a couple of scenes that depicted the absolute brutality of the &#34;Horrors,&#34; but, I felt like they were both perfunctory and obligatory.  The thing that annoyed me most (spoiler alert!) were the deaths of Erasmus and Mendelssohn.  Were they really necessary?  I mean, rabies?  Really?  Was it to show that something that is so innocent and happy as a dog could become mad and murderous?  I don't know. If so, i thought it gratuitous.  Truthfully, the best part of the book are the last 13 pages &#34;Games for Gustav.&#34;  I was moved more by those brief lines than entire rest of the book.  Maybe he should have made it a Flip Book so I could have started there first.<br \/><br \/>If you want some really good fiction about the Holocaust, try the Book Thief by Markus Zusak.

But I was looking to get a can of something \"better\" for a cheap gun frame. Idk about the durability or quality of this paint because the can and nozzle don't work. Followed all directions on can exactly. Here's what happens. Can starts off spraying with some sputtering for a few seconds then it sprays a nice beautiful mist, then the mist randomly starts getting thicker and sputters out again ruining my frame. Well it ruined what I was trying to do, the frame is soaking in a stripper right now. The can was shaken for no less than 5 min. Can was warm when applying as per directions. It's just worthless. If I wanted a short cut a can of krylon would have done me better.<br \/><br \/>Update: I have a lot of junk laying around and decided to try this on some stuff that I don't care about. What I noticed throughout the process is that using 220 micro grit paper to prep the surface is essential for the strongest bond. Normally with duracoat or kylon I use a 400 and it's perfect for a strong bond. With this stuff it is not. That being said, krylon is still stronger in my opinion. I oven cured the brownells for 2 hours at about 180-200 degrees on each surface prepped with different grits. Let all sit for 2 days then scratch tested them. On all of them the scratches were tearing of flakes of paint. I do not have this issue with kryon.  The other big issue was the lack of consistency with the spray. As it went on really uneven and had these splatters and splotches. I still have that issue but in the process of oven curing, it smoothed out a little bit. Still not as good as cheaper options. So i still conclude that your should just use krylon.  Do all your normal prep; sand, degrease by cleaning then low temp in oven to draw out more oil then hit with brake cleaner, paint with matte krylon (dries really fast between coats), oven cure for a few hours or air cure for a few days, finish with fast drying krylon matte clear coat. I promise you will have a better result than this over priced stuff.",

  "text":"I stopped reading this book after 16 chapters, roughly 20% through, because Nothing Happens.<br \/><br \/>The author does this baffling thing where he jumps between three different time-lines in the story. We go between &#34;Last Night&#34; &#34;Two Days Ago&#34; and &#34;Ten Years Ago.&#34;<br \/><br \/>Three or four chapters are spent with two characters whining as they dig up a grave. Whose grave? I don't know, we've not been told yet. Why are they digging up the grave? &#34;To send a message&#34;. That's all we know.<br \/><br \/>Several chapters are spent with the main character and his old cellmate as they meet another character. We actually get to see the Main Character and his Cellmate in jail, just before they break out. Do we get to see the breakout? No; the chapter actually ends just before they break out, and then picks up a week later.<br \/><br \/>More chapters are spent ten years ago, introducing the main character and the main antagonist back in college. We see them interacting, we see the rival's girlfriend, we see them selecting a thesis, we see them trying to gain superpowers in not-very-exciting ways.<br \/><br \/>We don't even learn what the main character's superpowers ARE until roughly chapter 14.<br \/><br \/>I've finished 1\/5th of this book and I am bored out of my mind. For a book with superpowered characters, we don't see them actually using them to do anything. We don't learn about the setting. We learn barely anything about the characters - all the main character shows us is that he's A) Smart, B) hates his parents, C) secretly hates his best friend\/rival, and D) regrets his course of action. We know next to nothing about the other characters, and they do so little to actually define their characters.",

There is a message - revealed at the very end - which makes for a good movie premise about Alien lifeform on Earth - unfortunately, everything you watched before it has you scratching your head wondering WHAT is going on! And takes way too many paths to get there. There is one small subplot with a few closeups that never goes anywhere. I kept wondering when that would come into play. But it never does, it got lost. And then there is another subplot that you think is going to build into some dramatic climax - only to be reduced to a comical waste of film and time. And the acting is so poor from the leads ... even the 50's flicks had some decent acting! One good thing is does have going for it - the music. That was actually decent in building up dread - unfortunately, the build up never happened.

  "text":"I was really excited about getting this hair dye and using it but sadly it was a GIGANTIC disappointment \ud83d\ude2d<br \/><br \/>1.) On the bottle, in the item description, etc it says that the color lasts for 45 washes but I can promise you that it does NOT last that long heck it barely even lasted 10% as long as it claims to (and yes that's even with me only washing my hair in cold water, only washing my hair once a week, using color protecting products, etc). Within only 4 washes the color has drastically faded and there's even some spots where the color has completely washed out already leaving bleach blonde patches. There's a few semi\/demi hair dyes i've used that will still stay pretty even when fading but unfortunately this isn't one of them- it's not ugly per say but it's really bland, lifeless and has me wanting to rush to the store to buy some more hair dye so I can fix it ASAP. I never thought in a million years i'd ever find a semi\/demi hair dye that was worse then Splat when it came to fading but man this dye takes the cake- with me taking care of my colored hair properly Splat will last me 10 washes before it gets to the \"ew ugly it faded I need to do a touch up\" stage whereas once again this only lasted 4 washes.<br \/><br \/>2.) This color isn't teal in fact it's more of a dark blue with teal highlights\/shine that you can only see if you're outside or standing directly under a light inside. I bleached my hair beforehand getting it 100% bleach blonde because I wanted it to be as bright as possible and even with that it still came out dark (and even while fading it looks blue have yet to see any green). I can't speak for anyone else but a genuine teal color is the unicorn of hair dye in my world- i've been dying and cutting my own hair pretty much only using semi\/demi hair dye for over 10 years now and in all that time I have yet to find a genuine teal color. I've pretty much tried every brand I could get my hands on with zero luck- it's either dark blue with teal highlights\/shine like this one, 98% green with 2% blue, green, dark green, blue, etc. I know going to a salon is an option and is probably my best bet to get genuine teal but because of my failings for the last decade i'm terrified of spending a couple hundred dollars just to end up with a non teal color again \ud83d\ude23. What in the world is going on? \ud83e\udd23 It's not the olden days where getting colors is impossible and we had to make our own colors using rare to find items it's 2022 so surely there's a way to get a GENUINE TEAL hair dye!<br \/><br \/>3.) I can't speak for anyone else but in my experience this is hands down the thickest hair dye i've ever come across. This wouldn't of been an issue for me had the bottle design been the same as a lot of other semi\/demi hair dyes are (a short easily accessible resealable cylinder) but since it wasn't and instead was put into a thick, dark and non flexible bottle it was next to impossible to get all the dye out or even see how much was in there. To get it out you either have to mix in some really watery hair conditioner or cut the bottle open and hope you don't hurt yourself or get dye all over the place in the process. While the design is visually really cute it's not practical- you end up wasting a lot of dye because you can't get it all out, in an attempt to get the remaining dye out you have to risk injuring yourself or getting dye all over the place or diluting it, since the bottle is black you have no idea how much dye is in there when you first get it so you won't know if you've been ripped off or not after getting a lot out you'll have no idea how much is still in there, because the dye is so thick and it's badly designed you end up having to constantly hit the bottom of the bottle\/squeeze on it really hard\/shake it hard etc just to get it out which after 20+ minutes really hurt my hands, you can't use the dye right out of the container like you can with the other cylinder hair dye containers and finally because you can't store any left over dye- the opening is so darn tiny there's no way you'll be able to get this thick dye back inside to use later on.<br \/><br \/>4.) This cost me $12.99 plus tax per bottle (it took 4 bottles to do my hair because I have really long thick hair) and when I bought it the price didn't bother me in fact it's pretty much average as far as semi\/demi hair dye goes (the cheapest hair dye I use costs $10 a piece and the most expensive I use is $15 a piece so this is right in the middle) but after taking into account that it's not a genuine teal color, how insanely quickly it fades, how unpractical the design is, that I can't store unused dye, how much ends up going to waste and all the other negatives the price is definitely not worth it to me.<br \/><br \/>5.) If you've used semi\/demi hair dye as much as I have then you already know about the notorious staining and bleeding that comes with these types of hair dyes haha but FYI this one is worse then what you're used to. With every other semi\/demi hair dye i've used by the second wash the bleeding stops, the staining on my skin and ears has gone away, it doesn't stain my skin and ears while wet, scratching my scalp doesn't result in stained fingers and dye under my nails and my fingers won't get stained while I wash my hair but with this dye all those negatives have continued all the way past the 4th wash. Basically this dye has all the negatives of semi\/demi hair dye but NONE of the positives \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f<br \/><br \/>So all in all I really don't like this hair dye and wouldn't recommend it. Tbh the only thing it has going for it is that it does make my hair feel really soft and doesn't leave a weird coating on my hair like some other semi\/demi hair dyes do but that doesn't mean much when everything else was a fail. Now that I think about it though I think this dye would be perfect for people who either only want crazy colored hair for a short period of time (like for a halloween costume, cosplay, an event, etc) or for parents whose kid's want to dye their hair a crazy color because it fades really quickly and isn't bright at all and is pretty mellow for semi\/demi dye, as for vets like me who actually want long lasting bright color STAY AWAY \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude02",

The lack of ability to customize defaults properly is an ongoing frustration. Also, for some reason, reports selectively do not include my husband, although everyone else's spouses seem to be there. He appears in certain reports and not others. Trying to import the books I had saved in earlier versions has been a disaster.<br \/><br \/>I want to add another major change\/problem in this version. Genealogy Register Reports no longer show spouses of childless marriages! Previous versions did show information, including facts and notes on all spouses. In FTM 2009, if a person has had multiple marriages but children from only one marriage, ALL spouses are mentioned by name. But if you have no children with your current spouse, or are a newlywed, or have a gay partner, your spouses are no longer mentioned in the reports.

The Bunn made 1\/3 more but had no where near the consistency this maker has from pot to pot nor the accuracy of receiving 4 cups of coffee out of the maker when you ask it to make you 4 cups of coffee. The Bunn you never really knew what was going to come out. Even though it was used daily the Bunn would often produce 3\/4 of a pot of coffee even though I poured 12 cups of water in.. You have to use it every day in order to keep the pre-heated water from evaporating, I guess?<br \/>The thermal carafe is just ok if you buy this your third cup of coffee will probably need to go directly into your microwave for a bit.<br \/>It still makes a dam good cup of delicious coffee and that I guess is what's most important.<br \/>Update;<br \/>Although I always use filtered water and clean the maker regularly this machine has developed a problem where it dosen't brew the entire pot of coffee.

I live more in the country, I know where the underground lines are, the phone and electric run close to each other strait out of my yard, there are no other buried lines or anything else that could cause issues with the system as I had read. I had to purchase an additional spool of line and used nearly all of it.<br \/>We worked with my then 6 month old white lab to teach him his boundary with he flags and all. This seemed to work well for the first several months. Then I noticed he would not play when he was outside and the collar was on him (we only put the collar on him when he was outside) He would not play he would automatically sit on our deck in the same spot every time. After some more time he seemed to be erratic about where he would go, He would appear spastic in his walking around the yard, changing directions very frequently so it would appear as if he was zig-zaging across the yard for no apparent rhyme or reason.<br \/> At this point we got worried about the dog, but he would always be fine when he was inside, would play and act normal. Finally it got to the point when we would put him outside with the collar on he would walk around the yard for a moment and sooner or later (usually sooner) he would end up running to the neighbors yard, end up playing with their kids or their puppy. I passed it off as him being a curious puppy wanting to play. I would retrieve him, he would run again. Finally it got to a point where he would simply not want to go outside, and when he would he'd run almost everytime right away and even if the neighbors weren't home he'd just sit on their front step. The last time this happened I was extremely frustrated not understanding what was going on, frustrated at the dog and myself trying to figure out how I was failing in training this beautiful dog our family loved.<br \/>When I was walking him back we neared the line to enter our yard, I took off the collar so I didn't shock my pup. My hearing isn't so good so I don't normally hear the collar chirp when it nears the line even when I was with my pup. This time I listened to it, it chirped as expected nearing and crossing the line. I was planning on putting my dog inside so I didn't bother putting it back on him I just carried it in my hand. Our yard is large about 50 yards wide at the most narrow point and the front yard is about 80 yards deep until the house. I was walking about in the middle of the yard with my dog on a leash, the pet safe collar in my hand when I heard it start to chirp. I couldn't believe it. I put my pup inside and walked all over my yard and over to my neighbors house. To my horror the collar would do the shock chirp randomly in my yard. There was no rhyme or reason, no consistency of any kind in placement or timing. It would go off anywhere in the front or the back yard in the middle of the yard, near the house, and of course also by the perimeter. In my neighbors yard it would not go off at all, my neighbors house where my pup would run to is close to 80 yards away.<br \/>My dog has been turned into a fun loving playful dog that loved to play fetch outside to a dog that is afraid to go outside and this product has essentially trained him his only safe spot is the neighbors house.",

  "text":"I am very enthusiastic about this category of product. I have used the Wii Fit at least weekly for over a year. The Wii Fit is great fun and is a superb stress management system, but is a poor cardio workout. So when I read reviews of EA Active as a more cardio Wii Fit, I bought it.<br \/><br \/>I have used Active almost daily for over a month and it is a very disappointing product. Active has many, many problems but the biggest is that Active does not deal with data coming from the nunchuk and wiimote effectively. For example, if you run at a constant pace, every few seconds you will get alternating instructions such as \"too slow\" and \"perfect\" as the Active is not interpreting the data properly. This also creates a frequent lag between your actions and the result on the screen. This becomes very annoying in the timing games (tennis, baseball, etc.). Instead of \"just working,\" like Wii Sports Tennis, you change the timing your swing to adjust for the lag.  Active has you exaggerate your actions during the exercises (e.g. \"point the numchuk at the ground at the conclusion of the exercise\") to compensate. As a result you need to concentrate on complying with these exaggerated actions to complete the exercise. And no matter how hard to concentrate you will never always get it right, resulting in Active nagging you and wasting your time. So while you should be getting in a positive frame of mind with an exercise product, with Active you end up getting frustrated with the poor product quality. Not fun.<br \/><br \/>There are many, many other shortcomings, but I will mention a few. The workouts are geared towards women. Like most men, I need cardio and abdominal\/core work. You will not get much of either with Active. Workouts emphasize toning arms and legs, typically not an issue for men. What passes for cardio is high impact jumping. You will jump over 100 times a workout. So unless you are under 25 and\/or a runner be prepared for sore knees. If you dig deep you can find one low impact (and even lower cardio) workout and the ability to customize workouts. However, it takes several minutes to set up a customized workout and it does not save them. So no cardio either.<br \/><br \/>There are plenty of other shortcomings - a really lame Me creator, Sega Genesis era graphics, balance board integration an afterthought - but you get the idea. On the positive side, Active has helped my wife get some exercise while the kids are home for the summer. In addition, the 30 day challenge provides some structure for those who are not self motivated. Our three kids, who love anything Wii, tried Active a couple times and dumped it.<br \/><br \/>We own Fifa 09 for the Wii. EA knows how to make games for the Wii. I am not sure what happened with the is product, but save your money, it is a disaster.",

I just received it a few moments ago and I am just destroyed. The top itself is probably cute once on, it appears to be as pictured in the ad. I can not really make a final determination though, due to the large, gaping hole in the sleeve. I do not buy clothing for myself very often and am very deliberate with my choices. So to have waited so long for a top that I normally don\u2019t spend this much on anyway, yes, I shop at Target mostly, and to receive what I call a poor product.<br \/><br \/>Now had the shirt arrived without this large hole, not to mention stray strings hanging and a couple of poorly sewn areas, it would probably be perfect. I\u2019m not really that picky. The hole is what I really take issue with.<br \/><br \/>It is literally a oversized shirt with cute sleeves. It is very boxy, no curves and certainly not form fitting. The style will come from what the individual makes of it. I am in love with the concept of the shirt. And I believe I would be in love with the actual shirt had I not received such a poorly made product. A few seconds of Quality Control would\u2019ve made a huge difference and caught this problem, which would have saved them money, because now I am going to have to return the shirt.<br \/><br \/>Note to seller - Take a few minutes to insure your product quality before you send it out to the customer.<br \/><br \/>Because of this, I would prefer no stars....but we are not allowed that option.",

After popping open one of the packs I determined why, the 18650 cells have the model number ICR18650-26V. They are manufactured by Eve, and their max discharge current is only 7.65a. Some m12 tools can draw over 30a! When an 18650 cell is used outside of it's spec range it can begin a process called thermal runaway, this process almost always ends in a fire or explosion. At best these batteries will have a short life ending in a fire. I will be making a video where I can present more information and possibly cause one of these batteries to melt down.

It promises to stream videos, music, and photos from your select Apple device to your Android device (presumably your FireTV Stick, which is the only reason that I purchased the app).

  "text":"Sarah (Kate Winslet), is a wife and stay-at-home mom who hates her life.  She perceives her husband as too controlling and resents having to nurture her daughter.<br \/><br \/>Brad (Patrick Wilson), is a husband and stay-at-home dad who also hates his life.  He perceives his wife as too controlling and is jealous that his son prefers her to him.<br \/><br \/>One day at a park, these two unhappy people meet and after exchanging some small talk, kiss each other on the lips...while their kids are right there watching.<br \/>Soon after, they intentionally spend lots of time together and unsurprisingly, end up having sex with each other...while their kids are in the other room sleeping.<br \/><br \/>Throughout the movie, these two demonstrated a disturbing level of narcissism.  When Sarah first kisses Brad, the narrator tells us she feels no guilt.  During sex, Brad asks if she feels any guilt and once again, none.  Brad had, at first, felt guilt, but then quickly becomes aroused.  In another scene, he acts smug that he's able to trick his wife into not suspecting he's cheating with the woman they're having dinner with.<br \/><br \/>This movie felt like a self-serving justification for adultery.  One way it justifies adultery is by portraying the betrayed spouses as lousy spouses.  Sarah's husband is portrayed as a weird, panty-sniffing porn addict...and Brad's wife is portrayed as a sexually withholding, controlling workaholic.<br \/>Therefore, the message is that if you had lousy spouses like these, you'd be cheating, too.<br \/><br \/>Another way this movie justifies adultery is by displaying a sharp contrast in intelligence between those in favor of adultery and those opposed.<br \/>In the book club scene, a group of women review the book, \"Madame Bovary\";.  Only one woman opposes the adultery in that book and does so in a very loud-mouthed, uneducated way. Her only argument against adultery is that any woman who commits it must be a slut.<br \/>Sarah, in contrast, calmly explains that this book isn't about cheating.  It's about feminism and how an affair empowers women to realize that being happy is their right.<br \/><br \/>The rest of the women nod their heads in agreement and feeling outnumbered, the lone protestor says she must've misunderstood the book's message.  But she didn't and here's two reasons why:<br \/><br \/>First, Sarah is confusing empowerment with a power trip.  A vow of fidelity is shared by two people, so both people get a vote if that vow is to be voided.  By not consulting her husband, Sarah was revealing how controlling she really is...which is ironic given she's using her husband's controlling behavior to justify her cheating on him.<br \/><br \/>Second, feminism is about empowering ALL women...including the wife being cheated on.  If Sarah cared so much about empowering women, she'd never help Brad strip his wife's power by cheating on her.  Since Sarah had no guilt for seeking happiness at this woman's expense, she was really just  exploiting feminism to justify her own self-serving behavior.<br \/><br \/>None of these arguments, however, are presented in this movie. Instead, any objections are presented in an irrational and uneducated way.  A side story in this movie plays out the same way.<br \/><br \/>The side story involves a pedophile who's just been released. The person objecting the most about pedophilia is portrayed the same as the woman objecting to adultery -- loud-mouthed, uneducated and irrational.<br \/><br \/>Another example is when the pedophile goes snorkeling in a public pool filled with kids.  When the parents realize who's in the pool with their kids, they dramatically order their kids to flee from him.  Again, people daring to stand up for their beliefs are portrayed as irrational and harshly judgmental.<br \/><br \/>What's ignored here is that the adulterers in this film are just as judgmental.<br \/>Although the adulterers don't want to be harshly judged, they have no problem harshly judging their spouses and even using those harsh judgments as justification to cheat on them.<br \/>And although the pedophile comes across as soft-spoken and gentle, he also seems to want everyone to just get over what he did and not pay any consequences for his actions.<br \/>Of course, he doesn't deserve to be abused or have his home vandalized...but is he entitled to enter a pool of half-naked children while he himself is half naked and wearing goggles (so he can check out their little bodies)?  No way.  These parents were perfectly justified in keeping their children away from him.<br \/><br \/>What's interesting is that this movie preaches against being judgmental towards non-conformists...yet, anyone who doesn't conform to the non-conformists are judged harshly.  So it's really a judgmental movie preaching against being judgmental.",

Went back this week and the regular price was $3.50 each so decided to see what Amazon had.  Was excited to find what I thought was a comparable price to Michaels sale price.  Shocked when only one box came in at a price of almost $9.00.  That is really high for a pretty \"shoe box\". Looking back on the site I see if you look at item description it says you are only getting one box.  Lesson learned, always read item description even if you think you already know what you are getting.",

To me, the box I received at the new and improved price of $23.00 was basically the same as the $15.00 a month subscription.  The company went up a ridiculous $8.00 a box.  Let that sink in for a minute.  $8.00 a month increase and it was not any better or more,of a value than before the increase. It looked the same.  You are promised at least three (code for 3, no more) full size products.  Well, one of the full size products was a bottle of nail polish!  The other two products claimed full size, but the products did not appear as such.  Allure's premiere better than ever box was a big fat dud.  And, it was the premiere box.  Makes you wonder what the rest of the boxes will be like.  To me it screams GREED and no concern for their loyal customers.  Let's increase the subscription $8.00 a month cause other beauty box subs are getting that much and send the customer the same box as before, they will not know any difference.  Well, Allure, we do know the difference and you can keep your subscription box.  You just lost a long, loyal customer.",

So my best judgement would say for them to remove the large Gluten Free advertisement if they are not 100% sure it's Gluten Free.  Seems reasonable.",

The game objectives can be difficult to figure out and the graphics are sub-par. The fighting is repetitive and gets boring pretty quickly. The button mashing action sequences will leave you frustrated as you do them over and over and over again until you get it right.<br \/><br \/>If you're looking for a Wii game that features strong Wii control features and well as good looking graphics and a well thought out storyline, then look to Zelda Twilight Princess or Resident Evil 4.

When I contacted customer service about it, they did offer to change out the type of toys she gets every month...however they just send smelly nylon toys that my dog hates and will not touch. On top of that, if you sign up for a subscription and your dog hates the toys, you cannot cancel, so now I'm stuck paying $30 plus dollars on toys my dog does not want and pork nibbles that she is getting bored with.

  "text":"I have gotten  a lot subscription boxes over the last 15 years. I did the New Beauty test tube and I used to prepay for the Allure quarterly boxes- the giant ones that were like 50 dollars and had all full size products (I still have hairspray from these boxes).  I have also done like Play, From the lab, Birch Box, Glossy Box , and some others that I can't remember right now.<br \/>This box featured an Olay whipped product as the gift for sign up.  Okay, no-no SPF and no discernible benefits from this product. Olay might try next time. Some horrible mineral sunscreen. Just an SPF 30 and like super ashy on whatever your skin color might be. So, no.  The lip balm was full size which is fine but it has a really strong smell. The sample size of the mask was probably two uses, the spray conditioner maybe like a week of usage, the Sunday Riley face oil is fine but the sample lasted 5 days (face, neck, and chest).  There were only two makeup items in the box The Makeup forever  artist pencil designed to used on eyes, lips, and cheeks, but in red this is strictly a lip pencil because how do you blend this into a blush? It's not soft at all so you can  Beauty Blend this until until your face bleeds because this is still not a blush and red eyeliner doesn't work on anyone but, the cast of True Blood. Red eyeliner makes you look like a junkie with allergies. Last  and  least that car wreck of an eyeliner. The color name on this product is Royal Blue, but it's really a matte turquoise long wearing and full-sized ( it's terrible but the plus side is there is plenty of it!). The formula and wear seem solid though (yes, I wore it around my house for a few hours) it's the color. The color is like a crayon- it's simultaneously vivid and flat. Here's the thing, I have a ton of Urban Decay liners in a variety of colors and the way that color works best in liner is if there is metallic element that adds reflection and dimension. This is just the truth. Matte  colors one-dimensional work best in black, brown, navy, gray,  maybe  plum. I get that these boxes are over flowing with black eye liners , but this blue isn't even a trend color. So, I canceled this box because everything in it was a total meh and I really hate the color of the eyeliner and I don't want anymore landfill fodder from any future purchases from whatever crank fiend Allure has curating this garbage box.",

  "text":"I am extremely disappointed with this headset. I expected a lot better from Razer.<br \/><br \/>I purchased the original version of the Carcharias in November of 2013 when it was a simpler model. See link: [[ASIN:B001PTH0VW Razer Carcharias Over Ear PC Gaming Headset]] The cord was braided nylon, the remote was diamond shape with simple volume and mute controls, and it has just a audio and microphone jacks. No USB powered nonsense, just plug it in and go.<br \/>Unfortunately my cat chewed the braided cord right through and rendered the headset useless. I do not know how to fix this myself and the warrenty of is several months over.<br \/><br \/>So I googled \"Razer Carcharias Headset\" and quickly purchased a new one thinking I would get the same item. I was extremely disappointed to receive an so called \"new and improved\" version of the Carcharias. Here's my breakdown of this product:<br \/>- The cord of this headset is all rubber... which in my opinion is lower quality than the braided rope<br \/>- The headset and earpieces seem to be the same. I am not keeping this headset long enough to test whether the comfort level differs.<br \/>- This newer version has a third USB piece along with the audio and microphone jacks which you MUST plug in to use the headset because it is USB powered. Words cannot express how disappointed I was to learn this. Also when you plug the USB in there is a buzzing sound which is just a huge no-no on headsets. I'm baffled that Razer allowed a product with such a huge defect replace the original version.<br \/>- The new remote gives you a lot more audio control, which would be nice if they even worked on my laptop... but I'll get to that<br \/>- The headset came with all sort of connecting shenanigans that I would not need because I am not using this for an X-box<br \/><br \/>I opened the box, got the headset out and plugged it in to test it... I could not get this headset to work on my laptop. No sound came through. Just the constant buzzing from the USB. To have to go through troubleshooting to try to fix these issues on a brand new headset is disheartening. You would expect to plug in and at least do its job and play sounds. Nope.<br \/><br \/>I love Razer products and have in a past had great experiences with them, but these Carcharias have spoiled it for me. I have contacted Razer customer service via e-mail and am awaiting their reply. Perhaps their service will restore my faith in their company.",

  "text":"Certainly one of my worst purchase over the last years.<br \/><br \/>I purchased this XP-600 since I had a good feedback from a friend who had a Epson workforce 545.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>- When printing in default setting, the results look great.<br \/>- Easy to setup<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>- You will notice that the ink cartridges are getting empty at a alarming rate. It's just ridiculous. I don't print pictures and this printer manage to drink all the ink.<br \/>So I had to use \"fast draft\" setting to limit the amount of ink used. It helps but it greatly decreases the quality and for god sake, why does the \"fast draft\" quality has to accelerate the paper mechanism that fast. It pulls the paper so fast that it gets not aligned and the printing is even more crappy. Fast draft should just decrease the amount of ink used, not print 1 page\/seconde.....<br \/><br \/>- Sometimes, you don't know what the printer is doing when you switch it on. You click on print, and wait 3 minutes.<br \/><br \/>Conclusion: Prints good, but prints at a high cost.<br \/>Don't go with this printer.",

Each time, I receive a brand new K95...and each one has failed with this repeating keys issue.<br \/><br \/>This keyboard has a design or manufacturing flaw that causes random letter keys to repeat 3-5x while typing. Consistently, each keyboard replacement that Corsair sent would be fine out of the box, but within 2-3 months the repeating keys issue would occur. And there's no solution or fix.<br \/><br \/>I'm currently on my fourth replacement K95...and at one month old, it now has the issue and I have to RMA it this week.<br \/><br \/>This is ridiculous for Corsair's flagship keyboard and at this high a price. Not only that, but I had to pay shipping of about $20 each time to send them back to Corsair. So including the price of the K95, I'm now out an additional $80 just for all the shipping costs, plus the inconvenience of packing it up and going to the post office each time, then waiting a week for a replacement.<br \/><br \/>Each time I've RMA'd one, I asked support if they're aware of this issue and\/or fixed it. Corsair support completely ignores the question and never answers it, sometimes giving a smart-ass annoying response, but never answering the question. Ever. All they do is send you another one after they receive the bad one, while ignoring your questions.<br \/><br \/>I've used Corsair PSU's, memory sticks, and other parts for almost 20 years in computers that I build for myself, friends, family, and clients. They've always been good products. The only products that I've seen fail so miserably are their mechanical keyboards. I've had a couple different models, including this atrocious K95. Corsair simply makes terrible mechanical keyboards and never fixes the issues with them.<br \/><br \/>I don't game or pound on the keyboard. I code, do graphics work, do email, surf the web, etc. Normal stuff in an office environment. But I like my computer gear to be top-notch and attractive, so I'll spend the dollars for the best gear & parts. The K95 is a beautiful keyboard...even the unboxing is luxurious, like opening a Tiffany's box...it's simply beautiful. But the K95's quality is terrible and I'm tired of replacing it ever 1-3 months and paying to do so.<br \/><br \/>Corsair...get your act together and fix this thing because I'm about to leave you and jump to a competitor's keyboards and products, seeing how impotent you've been fixing this thing.",

It is going back.  I spent $30 on box\/packaging material cause I had thrown away the original box it came in...I really wanted to keep this machine and tried every which way to make it work.  :(<br \/><br \/>Original Review:<br \/>I had high hopes for this dishwasher, as it's highly rated and I really needed one.  But the machine is not washing the dishes properly. I've tried multiple methods to no avail.  I even contacted the manufacturer; they couldn't troubleshoot (even when I sent them several pix) and just told me they're sorry.<br \/><br \/>I think the problem is the size of my dinner plates: they are 11 inches...even though I can fit them in at an angle, the water is somehow not reaching them...even when I put half as many as they say could be loaded.<br \/><br \/>According to the manufacturer when I called them (although this is not noted ANYWHERE in the manual) the maximum dinner plate size that fits is 9.5 inches.  That makes no sense since most dinner plates are 10-12 inches.  My salad-sized plates and utensils were cleaned just fine.<br \/><br \/>The other problem is how looooong it takes for the dishes to get done.  The &#34;Heavy&#34; program is supposed to take 100 minutes, but I timed it and it takes 137 minutes.  Similarly the &#34;Light&#34; program is supposed to take 75 minutes, but it took 105 minutes.  The &#34;Normal&#34; is longer than the &#34;Heavy&#34; program, but I didn't time it...it just took a really long time... close to 3 hrs!<br \/><br \/>Bottom line:  I accepted the fact that this is a really small dishwasher and it is for small batch washing, but the fact that they advertise it holds &#34;6 dinner plates&#34; is MISLEADING advertising...indicate the plate sizes if you've got nothing to hide!",

It's wrapped up in a cute box, bag, wrapping paper, tissue paper or something that shows they cared about the product inside. They all have came with description of each item inside. They usually, at least with the first delivered box, have a thank you for being a new subcriber note of some kind.

I can not believe that this could possibly weather the elements year round. She actually looks dirty like this was used. I get it is supposed to look like faux granite . She was not inexpensive. I guess I will be returning her, perhaps they can send a replacement but now I am Leary. So very disappointed as this got very good reviews and the photos submitted by other customers looked very nice. She also has a hole in the base, which I would think you could fill with sand but there is no plug to close it up with. I am very unhappy to say the least. If I am able to get a replacement and it is in better shape I will happily amend my review, until then buyer beware.<br \/>***UPDATE *** I was able to get a replacement statue sent to my house. She is beautiful. It came intact , the hands had all the fingers and the color was perfect. I do believe I was sent someone\u2019s return. Amazons customer service was wonderful. So the other statue is on its way back. Now Mary will be a beautiful addition to my garden. I am very happy with this purchase now.",

  "text":"My one star is meant to indicate my dissenting vote. Everyone else here may have loved this but I didn't. Why? This is yet another classic cartoon character to later be marred by a snarky tone. The plot synopsis says that Fred, who has the role of Scrooge in a play of Dickens' &#34;Christmas Carol&#34;, turns into one. But this happens because Fred gets a big head, not due to any malevolence on his part. Wilma, however, completely out of character, does turn into a Scrooge. Both of these subplots way overshadow the actual performance of the play. The Director let her snarky tone ruin that entirely. So I would not recommend watching this at all. A much better animated Dickens version is &#34;Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol&#34;. However, the included episode on this disc, from the Flintstones entitled &#34;A Christmas Flintstone&#34; is well worth watching. This disc is also included in the 4 Kids Favorites Holiday Family Fun Collection DVD pack which includes 'Yogi Bear's All Star Christmas Caper&#34; which is an excellent holiday feature with a cast of lots of popular H-B characters,, along with Two Rankin-Bass specials, &#34;Jack Frost&#34; and &#34;A Miser Brothers' Christmas&#34;. There have been a great many very good Hanna-Barbera specials that are well worth watching. What's the difference? This special dates from the '90s, a time when many classic characters were being ruined by studios which viewed them simply as &#34;properties&#34; and allowed people to write for, animate, and direct them who had no sense of the characters. Look what happened to Garfield. this contrasts mightily to the heyday of Hanna-Barbera and such earlier specials as the excellent &#34;A Jetson Christmas Carol&#34;.",

  "text":"Lucrezia Borgia certainly is a great opera, and I am glad that so many people enjoy this performance, but I feel obliged to look at it from a different perspective and to report on the reasons for my view.  Sutherland, at the time of this recording, was experiencing vocal difficulties that severely limit her impact in the role, both musically and dramatically.  I say this because I have the unofficial recordings of her live performances in Houston, April 1975, (as well as a 1972 tape from Toronto.)  In 1975 Houston, the great soprano was truly at the peak of her art, histrionically and vocally. Her passion is such that flames practically leap out of the speakers.  Vocally, she is impossibly great: powerful, flexible, spontaneous, daring, reckless, perfect.  But very soon in that same year she would develop a wobble in the lower middle register which would later invade the whole instrument.  1977 finds her moving slowly and carefully through the music, spontaneity gone with all attempts at drama abandoned.  The awful contrast of her vocal means between the Houston performances and the Decca recording is sufficient to squelch for me any enjoyment from this set, despite the excellence of the rest of the cast.  Sorry!",

Even if I used the straps, those look like they could cause some damage too if you had any dust or dirt under them. If this case was made with any quality you wouldn't need straps to help it fit! Oh and it smells really bad. No chance of it airing out. I'm thoroughly disappointed. I'd taken great care of my vita, no protectors or cases and not a single scratch.

I'd look for something that doesn't need straps and holds the vita more snugly and also doesn't touch the screen.

  "text":"From the reviews here it seems there are some quality control issues with this product. At least 10% of the reviewers have posted something negative about the quality and build. Some unfortunately received shoddy product that doesn't last.<br \/><br \/>I read the bad reviews and ordered a pair on Amazon anyway. It's such a great deal for studio monitors that I felt the risk was worth it. I also purchased M-Audio's SBX10 companion subwoofer for these at the same time.<br \/><br \/>I made my purchase on October 14, 2011 and regret it due to a combination of poor build quality and bad customer service.<br \/><br \/>I unfortunately received one good speaker and one bad one. But worse than the inconsistent quality of this product is the ongoing terrible customer service that M-Audio provides. Amazon's customer service, by the way, is still excellent.<br \/><br \/>First, a little bit of my gripe before I go into the details:  For almost two months now I've been speaking with representatives, escalating and speaking with managers, getting contrary information and instructions from different representatives, and having my last few emails sent to them ignored (one on 12\/13 and two on 12\/20). I've even told one of the customer representative that I would write a review on Amazon about this but that I would be willing to wait about a month to give them a chance to resolve this. This was over a month ago in November. So here is the truthful review:<br \/><br \/>PROS<br \/>- The sound quality (if you're lucky to get a good set of speakers) is very good. It's not amazing, as some reviewers suggest. You're basically getting the audio value of studio monitors that might cost twice as much - but not much more. Studio monitors from a reputable brand that cost $300 or more will sound better than these. With that said, within its current price range, these sound very good - comparable to the low end KRKs.<br \/>- The small size is great. But if size is your premium and cost is not, I'd go for the Genelec 8030As which are the same size (and a bit lighter!) and completely blow these speakers out of the water in terms of performance. The sound difference is night and day.<br \/><br \/>CONS<br \/>- Volume controls are on the back. that's annoying.<br \/>- Quality control is bad. I was one of the unlucky 10% customers with issues. One of my speakers doesn't project any midrange sound during the first 10 minutes it is on. After 10 minutes, the speaker seems to \"warm up\" sufficiently to sound like the other speaker, but then will occasionally make popping sounds. I don't get any of these issues with the other speaker.<br \/>- Warranty policy is BAD. Sometime in early 2011, M-Audio changed their warranty policy so that DEFECTIVE items must undergo the following burdensome process to get fixed:<br \/>  1. Customer must mail the product back to the sender and his\/her expense. Since this is a speaker and the box is fairly large, shipping won't be cheap.<br \/>  2. Once M-Audio receives the product, it can (and usually will) take up to 14 business days (three normal weeks) to process, review, fix and then dispatch to ship out to you.<br \/>  3. Once dispatched out, it can take another 5-7 business days to receive the product from the shipping company.<br \/>Basically, you pay for shipping AND you must wait at least a MONTH to receive your repaired speaker back. This is really bad policy for something like speakers. And it especially hurt since I had owned it less than 2 months when I first contacted M-Audio in November 2011.<br \/>- The customer service support is bad. They seem disorganized. Different people supposedly working on my issue are giving me contrary information and advise to this very day (12\/29\/11). After escalating my issues several times, I chatted with someone who said that they would make an exception - especially since this was a recent purchase with their subwoofer as well. He told me that they would ship me a new speaker and that I just had to ship back the defective speaker in the same box. This would have been an excellent solution. However, it's been over three weeks since I was promised this and in the meantime, I have been asked by different customer agents to ship my product to them at my expense to get the repair process started. I've since spoken to the sales agent again last Friday (12\/23\/11) and he apologized for the confusion and said he would fix the matter. It's now been a week since that call and still nothing.<br \/>- The accompanying subwoofer SBX10 is way too overpowered for these speakers. M-Audio curiously endorses this subwoofer as a companion to the studio monitors but this is wrong. I have the subwoofer set at the lowest possible volume setting and still find the bass completely overpowering in relation to the studio monitors. The studio monitors are at 80% volume so this is a bona fide mismatch. I'll post another review of the subwoofer in Amazon shortly.<br \/><br \/>To summarize, here's the deal. The sound is great for the budget price. But, based on reviews here and my experience, you have something like a 10% risk of getting a defective product. And quite often (based on reviews here) you won't know you have a defective product until a few months of use when problems start to occur. Once you realize you have a defective product, you're faced with a burdensome warranty service  policy and potentially bad customer support.<br \/><br \/>For these reasons, I strongly recommend against gambling on this product. Spend a little extra on something reliable.<br \/><br \/>*** UPDATE 12\/30 ***<br \/>They dropped the price quite a bit since I purchase it two and a half months ago. At the price as of 12\/30, it's practically a steal. It's so cheap that it's worth the gamble.",

I'd put Blue Velvet in the &#34;gems&#34; category; Prophet's Game is Number One on the list of stinkers. Everything about this show, from the plot to the acting to the lighting and sound, is utterly terrible. Stephanie Zimbalist provides a bit of brightness to the film just because she's Stephanie Zimbalist. And it was interesting to see Joe Penny, even though his character makes stupid decisions for obscure reasons. Overall, however, this flick is a total waste of time unless you're interested in studying the many ways to do film really, really badly.",

Once I finally got an &#34;undamaged&#34; product I was frustrated to discover that a number of the sockets bulged out of the fixture, the lightbulbs couldn't align properly, so the bulbs will flicker etc. For a $200 light fixture you would think the quality would be there, and it definitely isn't as these are made in China.  Their Italian counterparts are upwards of $400-$500, so you make decide to play 007 with the bulbs, get them to work and then stop breathing while you are in the room to assure the lightbulbs stay lit.  They look awesome...when they work.  PS the chrome bulbs are costly or impossible to find...you need 25 of them for one fixture.  So if you want it to look as picture be ready to spend another $75-$100.  1000bulbs.com was the cheapest place I could find the chrome bulbs.",

  "text":"I'm a newbie to vinyl collecting so this \"club\" seemed like a good fit. Joined in late November and got a record added to my cart a few days later, but it won't arrive until the very end of January. So a two month wait for The Who Sell Out...<br \/>In reading the other reviews it seems like not everyone gets the same record each month. Sounds like some people received The Who Sell Out a month or two before I joined.<br \/>So jury is still out... for a newbie with a starter collection like me this club could end up being good even if I get things people got months ago.<br \/>In doing more research after the fact it seems like this Amazon subscription (so far) is more basic than other monthly clubs. Nothing exclusive or special. The lack of transparency in selections (past, present, future) is odd and again makes me think we all don't get the same record each month.<br \/>The biggest concern for me is the other reviews saying that the monthly selection can at times be bought (on Amazon!) for less than the subscription price. If true that's pretty darn lame.  Yes, there are remedies (like skipping that month's subscription and buying record for the lower price) but to have to jump through those extra hoops to get the best price on their own website just speaks to the level of effort getting put in on their side.<br \/>So again... jury is still out, but not off to a great start.",

  "text":"With some simple hand gesturing and going through the motions, the band known as 10cc died with the release of this album.<br \/><br \/>This album was created out of contractual agreements, bad producing decisions and the least amount of contribution by one of it's original members since Sir Anthony Hopkins' 16 minute Oscar work for \"Silence of The Lambs.\"<br \/><br \/>Listening to this album, which clocks in at a quick 54 minutes and 10 tracks, reminds me of a bit of Sting's 90's solo efforts with a touch of Phil Collins and a dash of Peter Gabriel. A few of the songs are a bit introspective, subtle, rich and will be a treat for your ears. The rest are horrible abortive projects that should have stayed in someone's writing satchel.<br \/><br \/>The shame of it is why the album was created and the what the results were.<br \/><br \/>Kevin Godley and Lol Creme had a contractual agreement with Polydor for one last album and they decided that they didn't need the albatross tied around their necks any longer. After contacting Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman, the album was begun in earnest in late 1991.<br \/><br \/>Sadly, a combination of the \"band\"'s usage of a new producer and utilizing many other artists to help create the sound for their album shows it's lack of cohesiveness.<br \/><br \/>Here's 10 songs, and here's my 10 second review of them:<br \/><br \/>1. \"Woman in Love\" - Six minutes of light radio filler - who decided this would be a hit of any sort? Even for 1992 this sounds overproduced.<br \/>2. \"Wonderland\" - A bit of light fun, once again a total 1992 experience, which says something here - ugh, I really did not like this song - it's like overcranked Jimmy Buffett lyrics and lite jazz flavored ice cream. Bleah.<br \/>3. \"Fill Her Up\" - A kind of rocker - still, it's so syrupy lite I'm getting a toothache!<br \/>4. \"Something Special\" - Despite the wonderful piano of Dr. John, it's boring, the lyrics right out of some amateur's songbook. There's no life in this song at all... yet it segues right into...<br \/>5. \"Welcome to Paradise\" - one of the stronger songs of the album, and it has a cool reggae-scented sound, and is one of the only songs I listened to a second time to be sure I liked it as much as I did when I heard it the first time - yup, it's decent.<br \/>6. \"The Stars Didn't Show\" - Kevin Godley has even publically noted that his vocals here (and backing tracks on two other songs) were the only contribution to this entire album, and sadly it shows... and I liked this song a bit, and I wonder who the mystery \"man in black\" is here they're crooning about, but it's a short balld of sorts that doesn't go beyond repeating the chorus more than the lyrics...<br \/>7. \"Green Eyed Monster\" - this is the closest that 10cc sounds like the 10cc of old - staccato harmoious lyrics firing over decent music... too bad too sad for them, though.<br \/>8. \"Charity Begins at Home\" - another small glimpse of 10cc breaks through the endless echoes and layering of music, but once again, too little too late.<br \/>9. \"Shine a Light in the Dark\" - The harmonies are wonderful, but what they're singing is stinky, and the music is dull and uninspiring, and it sounds EXACTLY like Chicago's late 80's\/early 90's sound, with their middle of the road boring music so hypnotizing you could play it for your 18 month old child and they'd get a good nap in.<br \/>10. \"Don't Break the Promises\" - here's a interesting bit of trivia: this song was written by Paul McCartney & Eric Stewart (he'd been working with him for several years prior to this) and I think this was tacked on to appease Stewart and give the album a bit of A-list credibility - Graham Gouldman was also given a bit of writing credit, too - but it falls apart under the crushing weight of overproduction and moderate to extremely dull song performance - it's a shame, too, because I think this might have had a chance, somewhere.<br \/><br \/>So I listened to 10cc's album, and immediately gave it away to a friend. I'm just hopeful my friend doesn't hate me for giving them such painfully underperformed straight-from-the-songbook-by-the-numbers material.<br \/><br \/>I have to give it two stars only because I really don't want to give them one, yet this really shows me that the power of money can kill creativity in a heartbeat. I feel bad for these four guys, because they created one of the greatest songs ever off one of the great albums ever, but this?<br \/><br \/>This is an exercise in what not to do, especially when you all haven't been in a room together for the last 10 years and then decide to try and cohesively create something again that probably will never return once they left the room.<br \/><br \/>The result - like this album - will be sloppy overly-created garbage.<br \/><br \/>Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.<br \/><br \/>Please check out my other reviews of less painful music.

This one has none of that.  You simply wrap your hair (with your bare fingers)  around a burning hot rod and hopefully expect to come out with nice beachy waves.  Well let me tell you sister, none of that was going on over here.  I was so scared to burn myself I didn't hold the rod close enough to the base of the hair so I ended up with awkward weird curls at the tips of my hair.  The direction you wrap the hair also makes a difference as well as whether you hold the wand from the bottom pointing up as well as the top pointing down.  If you have a prayer of doing this right, for the love of all that is good hold it from the top with the rod pointing down and wrap hair from the base of the rod down toward the skinny end.<br \/>  Needless to say I never got the hang of this thing.  I gave it a 2 star rating because that means &#34;I don't like it&#34; in amazon terms.  On the more practical side it did heat up quickly (remarkably quickly actually), it even had a digital reading of the temp it was on so you can see it quickly heat up.  Now for all the people who are screaming at me &#34;try the glove you ninny!!&#34;  I did.  All that did was make me a little too brave with a hot rod and then I burned my head.

This has the batteries located on the back rather than on the bottom to prevent any water infiltration causing rusted battery connections. Sunlight has not been able to auto trigger the dispenser like other models. You can easily see how much soap is left in the container and it holds a ton of it.

I should have checked this out before I cut the mesh to size it (didn't contact the vendor, I think its unreasonable to ask them to do anything since I already sized the band, which requires cutting the mesh).  The clasp itself seems to be of good quality (thick metal, not thin stamped), but the holes on the second lock latch don't line up with the little pins that hold it in position.  I tried just squeezing the sides a little to make it tighter but it doesn't really help since the holes don't line up.  Its frustrating to have the otherwise great band made unusable by the misalignment of this little keeper, I will probably end up just cutting it off and wear it without it.

  "text":"Not well written at all, dialogue competing with the narration to be most stilted. The rule of \"show don't tell\" (not that I'm a strict rule follower) is completely obliterated, and perhaps the biggest sin for a book billed as a thriller - it was not particularly suspenseful or thrilling. I somewhat reluctantly pushed my way through since it was easy enough to read (the author makes little attempt to utilize poetic prose or vocabulary anyone would need to look up in the dictionary). But if you like your reading material to be of superior quality to something you could have written yourself by 9th grade, I recommend taking a pass on this tepid tale. English is not the author's native tongue, although he has become comfortable enough with it to write a couple novels in English according to his bio. I'm not entirely sure if Hidden in Havana is one of them or if it was translated, but either way it fell short of my expectations for a work of fiction put out by a major publisher (or a minor one, or self pubbed for that matter). I learned a little about Cuba in the process of reading this book, which is cool because I'm a bit of a Cubaphile. Other than that this was a novel soon to be forgotten. I'm actually forgetting it as I write these words.",

That was really annoying because you couldn't see anything around them.  Another glitch was in the last case of the first disk, no matter what location I went to, it always looked like the suspect's apartment...and Catherine was always floating in the air.  That meant that I couldn't see any of the evidence that was supposed to be at that location because it always looked like the apartment that I had already searched.

They are comfortable and the lace allow for easy adjustment to make it tighter or looser.

In theory this is great, but if the shoes happen to be a half size and you need to make the shoes significantly tighter, than the lace stick out alot and therefore can't utilize the Velcro or it looks weird.<br \/>At closer examination of the shoes, I was disappointed in the edge\/stitching. The edges are not closed, the material & it's multi-layer is exposed. (See the pictures and the highlighted section.) For short term, these would suffice, but I don't trust these to last long term, or beyond a year or 2,<br \/>I chose the grey style. I don't recommend this style because the back\/heel section has a 2 stich section\/pattern. While this looks good, it makes the heel bunch together and hard to slip your feet in easily.

  "text":"Sunset Magazine was a staple growing up. All my grandparents subscribed to it. They clipped recipes and affordable DYI projects that enhanced their lives. My parents liked Sunset for planning inexpensive car trips for our family and the excellent, in-depth articles on gardening and landscaping. Old issues were carefully stored and the associated books were bought with barely a preliminary review. You knew you were getting quality, well-researched information and ideas when you bought anything Sunset Magazine-related.<br \/><br \/>After the Lane Family sold Sunset to Time\/Life in the early 1990s, the focus changed. The warm editorial voice and trusted experts began to be pushed aside for more product tie-ins and a very regimented editorial calendar. The front of the issue took on the generic, a \u201cpotpourri\u201d of small articles and \u201cfinds!\u201d that had existed in other magazines. Sunset followed the art and editorial examples set by Martha Stewart, Coastal Living, and Better Home and Gardens. Sunset lost its unique West Coast voice and became far more generic.<br \/><br \/>When Katie Tamony took over as editor in the early aughts, the party was over. The garden sections was often reduced to 1 or 2 pages. Almost all of the garden and landscape articles served as publicly pieces for professional nurseries and landscape architects. There were precious few articles that reflected the burgeoning online gardening scene, with no coverage of how auction sites, craigslist, and online nursery sales were changing Western gardens. The Sunset Idea homes were outrageously priced and unattainable. Environmental advocacy and education stories appeared once a year-if at all. Stories were shortened, photos emphasized and insipid first person narratives (good lord - Joel Stein!) were prominently featured.<br \/><br \/>There was the late-to-the-game wine club, metal patio furniture from Asia (painted to look like wood) and a hyped up line of garden plants - all items that can and could come from any retailer. An updated Western Garden Book was put aside by many of my fellow gardeners, due to a lack of online resources, no propagation section and valued anchor plants missing. The garden calendar was barely updated and the recipes lacked the wonderful mixture of California and Pacific Rim cultures that are predominating in the West. Like every other magazine, we had a Letter \u201cpersonally\u201d from The Editor, an over-thought (but award winning!) Table of Contents, and a retail catalog of services, items and experiences we could purchase. The magazine of Western Living had become the magazine of Western Buying.<br \/><br \/>Another low was the addition of celebrities on the cover. Josie Maran, Kelly Slater, Malin Akerman - congratulations on having fine publicists. No matter how many celebs you put on the cover, Sunset, I\u2019m buying your magazine for substance. I\u2019ll get People or EW if I want froth and carefully constructed celebrity profiles.<br \/><br \/>The current nadir is the \u201ccould have been an Absolutely Fabulous episode\u201d remodel of the current editor\u2019s newly purchased home in the East Bay. Current editor Irene Edwards has taken the narcissism of Instagram, Facebook and the utterly vacuous Remodelista, added product links, and presented something so self-indulgent, so utterly lacking in educational value, so lacking in service to readers that I continue to share it with others as a cautionary tale of bad magazine editorial conception and direction.<br \/><br \/>In 2017, Sunset was spun off by Time, Inc. to a Beverly Hills-based investor, Michael Reinstein. In 2018, there are more DYI projects, the website has been cleaned up, and the focus on education and service appears to be coming back. Hopefully, the new owners will look at Make, Dwell, Pacific Horticulture, regional magazines and websites, along with the Lane-era Sunset to create a new publication that truly inspires us to better Western Living.",

  "text":"I bought this dishwasher a couple weeks ago and have run it about once a day since. First of all... on a basic level, it is just so, so great to not have to hand wash dishes anymore.<br \/><br \/>I did a lot of research before I bought this model. It turns out pretty much every countertop dishwasher is made by the same manufacturer in China; they\u2019re just branded differently and have slightly different controls.<br \/><br \/>I picked this one mostly for the two year warranty, which was way better than Danby\u2019s. I decided a better warranty was worth the extra 40 bucks or so.<br \/><br \/>Pros: It\u2019s easy to install and use. There\u2019s very little assembly before you\u2019re good to go and start running a load. It holds a surprising amount, actually... I wasn\u2019t expecting my 11-inch skillet to fit, but it does, as long as I don\u2019t try to pack too much other stuff in at the same time. It can also hold up to medium-size pots, full-size tongs, etc. Pretty much everything has come out clean the first time so far! I\u2019ve been using Seventh Generation detergent packs, and they seem to work well with this machine.<br \/><br \/>Cons: it\u2019s kind of slow. But all mini dishwashers are, as far as I can tell. It also takes up significant space in a small kitchen. (I have a truly tiny kitchen, so I mounted it on a rolling metal cart from Cleanitsupply, and that works great! I just roll it in front of the sink when it\u2019s time to do the dishes and roll it back out in to the dining room when it\u2019s done.)<br \/><br \/>A piece of advice: Check the connections on the back each time before you turn on the water! If you move the hoses AT ALL after the last use, they can come slightly loose, and that will cause a leak if you don\u2019t retighten them before you start the next wash.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: Well, I used this thing about 3-4x week for 2 years total before it stopped draining properly (infuriatingly, just after warranty ran out). It throws up an error code and beeps for a long time when it's not draining well. I kept it limping along for a while by doing this tipping trick the manufacturer told me about when I called, but the other day it crashed and burned... started leaking out the bottom and wouldn't drain at all. I cleaned the hoses and got it to drain tonight, but now it just whirs and beeps and won't work properly.<br \/><br \/>It was great while it lasted but I expected more out of an appliance that cost several hundred bucks. I took good care of it and followed the instructions, so I'm pretty disappointed that it crapped out so early in its life.",

I found the main characters a little too immature for my taste.<br \/><br \/>Georgie is kind of a scatterbrain who is endearing when she's not pouting because of some perceived slight to her ego.  She is, on one hand, driven to meet her goal to fall in love with a delicious Italian man, and on the other hand she is not all that happy about it a lot of the time when she does.<br \/><br \/>Gianluca is the brooder.

  "text":"Really, I don't like this album much, but the repackaged CD with lyric sheet and photos missing since the original release on vinyl put back in are pretty fun.  Buy this version if you're a fan of the band.<br \/><br \/>My Original Review:<br \/><br \/>The Third Album was supposed to be the triumphal, world-conquering follow-up to \"Rio\". Instead it comes across as over-produced smarmy pop with an overblown title and bad cover art to boot. This is the one D2 album I hardly ever listen to. \"The Reflex\" is a promising start, but fair warning, the album mix is distinctly different from the Nile Rodgers produced single remix that hit #1 on the charts. \"New Moon On Monday\" is okay, but then the tracks descend into insincere pop inanity. \"Cracks in the Pavement\" and \"I take the Dice\" are pure pablum filler. Side one grinds to a close with \"Of Crime And Passion\", a song trying so hard to be edgy it ultimately spins off the 'ol turntable. \"Union of the Snake\" is solid chart material, the strongest song with a solid Bowie bass beat, excellent percussion and some good horn work. \"Shadows On Your Side\" comes off as an overdone uptempo number that seems to get to the chorus inside of 10 seconds and repeat it every 30 seconds thereafter. The band finally take a breath and stretch their creativity on \"Tiger Tiger\", an evocative instrumental number that leads in to the big finish \"The Seventh Stranger\", which is one of my favorite ballad\/atmospheric numbers from the band, and Andy Taylor's guitar solo theme work is gorgeous. The album ends abruptly, far short of it's intended goal. This album needs a serious \"Director's Cut\" style updating from Nick and Simon to bring it back to respectability. If they had included the \"Is There Something I Should Know\" single, the outstanding B-side \"Secret Oktober\" and the remixed single version of \"The Reflex\" they might have had something. Buy this version only if you have to have it to complete your collection.",

  "text":"Having thoroughly enjoyed _The Great Bridge_, I sailed into this book with a pretty strong tailwind. In fact, I defended the book unread in a comment to a previously-written negative review. That reviewer had lamented the lack technical detail such as of first-party notes; I suggested that such notes might not have existed. And so shame on me for a review in advance. Won't happen again. According to Mr. McCullough, such notes did exist -- so where were they? My recollection of _Bridge_ is that the Roeblings: Did pioneering work on suspension bridge technology, particularly with regard to span stiffness; caisson work in deep water (learned the hard way); spinning-in-place of suspension bridge cables; statistical quality control (and how the unscrupulous tried to bypass it); and other developments that led to an extremely robust, fault-tolerant bridge, all lucidly explained in sufficient detail to hold the technocratic reader. The Wright Brothers: Rewrote (and corrected) the handbook of empirical aeronautics; developed and applied wing warping to impart a measure of self-correcting stability (arguably the key to the castle, from a technical perspective); developed (and\/or employed the guy who developed) an engine light enough to fly and the propellers that it drove; and... learned to fly. I suspect that it is the fatal flaw of the book as literature: That there is no way to make a compelling story about an internal development. Their late predecessors had grabbed the tiger by the tail and been mauled by it; they acquired skill unpowered and at a safe altitude and speed.<br \/><br \/>It may be that Mr. McCullough concluded that learning to fly was so pivotal that more details on the other achievements would detract from that part of the story more so than useless details about what their sister wore... and after demonstrating flight, the book petered off into etc., etc., etc.. Attend: No airplane (save some contemporary imitators) built since has looked anything like the Wright Flyers; _The Spirit of St Louis_, IIRC, had a Wright Whirlwind engine. How did this come to pass? That would, to me, at least, have been more interesting than much of what was included.<br \/><br \/>That is not to say that the book was not, on the whole, enjoyable; merely not as informative as it could have been in areas that I had expected would be its strength. The two star rating is for the fact that the book starts out with a series of poorly conjoined vignettes so boring that I would not have gotten through the book had it not been a reading group selection.

  "text":"This kit is advertised as a 3D printer bed leveling kit. It does contain all the components of a bed leveling kit. The only issue is that they are about half the size of the components in a normal bed leveling kit. The spring that fits between the print bed and the frame is about half the height of a \"regular\" spring. This small size makes it practically useless. Leveling the print bed depends on having the height to raise or lower the bed as needed. These springs are so short that you can barely raise the bed. Forget about lowering it. The wheels are installed under the frame and are turned to raise or lower the bed. Being under the frame makes them difficult to get a grip on at the best of times but it's almost impossible to grip them effectively due to their diminutive size. For what it's worth, the items in the kit seem well made and of quality materials. That being said, I would not recommend the kit to anyone who has an interest in leveling their print bed.",

To its credit, as the previous reviewer also sated, the quality of the recordings is generally quite acceptable.<br \/><br \/>The selection of bands on these CDs is quite a hodgepodge, and some ensembles are featured quite heavily, where others are only given a single token tune. There seems to be little rhyme or reason to the organization of the tunes in this set, but there are, nonetheless, some very nice songs included on these CDs.  In fact, there are a few fantastic tunes that one rarely finds in compilations.<br \/><br \/>My thanks to the reviewer that corrected the track listings.  As I listened through the recordings, I've agreed with all his labels.  I'll add my findings to assist anyone else who is searching for the correct titles.  I believe the correct labels for the tracks he has listed with question marks are:<br \/><br \/>2 11 A Foggy Day - Artie Shaw<br \/>2 12 Skylark - Harry James and His Orchestra with Helen Forrest on vocals<br \/><br \/>I hope that this, in conjunction with the previous review, helps anyone else searching for the correct track labels, as I was.",

  "text":"&#34;Dark Lightning&#34; is the fourth in Varley's self-described Heinlein Juvenile tribute novels and, according to Varley's website, probably the last of the series.  Which is a shame, because the Thunder and Lightning books deserve a better finale than &#34;Dark Lightning.&#34; Maybe Varley lost interest in the series or maybe &#34;Dark Lightning&#34; was written to fulfill a contractual obligation. Whatever happened, it's the weakest book of the series, and one of the weaker books of Varley's career.<br \/><br \/>There's very little good to say about the book. The plot is plodding, weak, and unbelievable. While it superficially parallels Heinlein's &#34;Orphans of the Sky.&#34; the storyline has nothing of the excitement of that 70-year-old book.  Similarly, while the two main characters are nods to the &#34;unheavenly twins&#34; from &#34;The Rolling Stones,&#34; unlike Castor and Pollux, Cassie and Polly are superficial, wooden, and not even particularly likeable. While I would have always had one hand on my wallet around Cas and Pol, I would enjoy their company.  Can't say the same about Polly or Cassie, who would seem to be most interested in whether I was giving the appropriate male attention to their butts.<br \/><br \/>If you haven't read the Thunder and Lightning series, please start with the first and best, &#34;Red Thunder,&#34; which *is* a wonderful homage not only to Heinlein, but also to the works of John D. MacDonald.  &#34;Red Lightning&#34; is almost as good and &#34;Rolling Thunder,&#34; while having issues, is still a great read. &#34;Dark Lightning&#34; isn't.  I wish it was, and, as I said at the beginning of this review, I really hope Varley reconsiders and writes the capstone book that the series deserves.  Certainly the conclusion of &#34;Dark Lightning,&#34; with its references to &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; and &#34;Tunnel in the Sky&#34; hint that Varley has the germ of a follow-up story in mind.  If we're lucky, maybe we'll get to see it.",

They are described as having a mouth opening \u201cwide enough for most ice cubes,\u201d and this is just not true. Our ice maker makes cubes no bigger than 1.5\u201d x 1.5\u201d and we have to use the butt of a butter knife to push them through one by one, so I would say it\u2019s very doubtful that this opening is wide enough for \u201cmost ice cubes.\u201d  At best they are suited for crushed ice. Secondly, I ordered the larger 25oz size as we had been using 24oz plastic ones and figured they would be similar in size. Of course, because they\u2019re metal, the 25 oz in this model turns out to really be just too heavy for practical everyday carrying around everywhere use. It does fit fine in our main car\u2019s cup holder, but doesn\u2019t come close to fitting many others.  Lastly, we purchased replacement flip tops that fit all of the other smaller topped metal water bottles our friends have, but they are too wide for these, so that ought to tell you the opening in these is smaller than average. So, all in all, not a satisfied customer and it wasn\u2019t until these had been washed and put to use that all of these flaws were made apparent, so we are now stuck with pricey, though pretty, heavy water bottles that are just impractical in many ways.",

One can imagine the seminal day in pre-production wherein the brain colony synchronistically flatulated what they believed to be a story line and moral dilemma, involving medieval houses of candy, Gattlin guns, witch gangs and killer orphans (leave no pre-pubescent button unpushed, or rather, no zit unsqueezed). Throw in to the cauldron randomly generated witch lore to prop up the scatalogical epistle of events and we are left with a jello sausage limping along with the help of a walker.<br \/>The actors were gorgeous, disturbingly so, though the troll reminded me of a neighbor. They needed the paycheck. Who can blame them? One can empathize, but soneone's neck needs to be stretched for this one.<br \/>Don't get me wrong, I was entertained, enthralled by speculating on the subconscious message of time- lapse aging female faces into cracked and withered facades. Tittilated by witches on low-altitude broomsticks who reminded me of imperial storm troopers whizzing between forest trees.

In August they stuck in a moisturizer made in China as their main product and then it went downhill from there.  Instead of fucusing on luxury skincare, which is what their fan base really wants, September and October had cheapie makeup in it.  November's, which I didn't get has an eyelash curler as one of the main products and then some non- waterproof mascara as the two main products.  You can get this quality at half the price with other makeup boxes.  I don't know if another subscription brand will focus on luxury skincare but that's what I really want.  Please see my review below from summer of 2021.<br \/><br \/>------\u2010\u2010----------------<br \/><br \/>This beauty box, judging by the last two months is really more for people who like skincare.  I LOVE it!  For makeup, they added a lip stain last month and brushes this month.  That's more than enough for me.  I love that I can get really high quality products for such a low price and try brands that weren't even on my radar.<br \/><br \/>This is geared more for discerning beauty conscious people, including those who are more mature.

  "text":"I teach classical guitar and have used all sorts of tuners over the years from the clunky analogue with the needle to the sleekest of the digital tuners.  I guess my overall favorite as far as tuning goes are the Snarks except they are prone to breaking off at the stem and I've had two do that.  My next favorite are the D'Addario tuners that clip onto the headstock of the guitar.  They are very accurate and easy to use.  I have used this particular tuner (D'Addario NS Micro Sound Hole Tuner) for a few days and it tunes as well as the others from 435 to 445 HZ. It is supposed to fit in the sound hole, but it's not a secure fit, at least not in my classical guitars.  The first time I tried to install it in the sound hole it fell inside my guitar and I had to loosen my trebles enough to retrieve the tuner and it's loose battery.  Then I really needed a tuner to re-tune my guitar afterwards.  Once I got it attached, it seems a little bit loose and therefore easy to come off and possibly fall back inside my guitar.  There is no way to adjust the grip. I don't think it will scratch the top of your guitar since it has a rubberized padding on the part that goes on the outside of the sound hole, but if you have a guitar you are particularly fond of, I would not leave this tuner on it for extended periods of time lest it leave a residue on your lovely rosette.  It will not tune down to 432 HZ which is considered by many to be a healing frequency.  It only goes down to 435.  It does not come with a black plastic cover over the battery, which I think it should, since it's easy for the battery to come loose and fall out, as it did when the tuner fell inside of my guitar through the sound hole.<br \/><br \/>Looking downward at the tuner instead of looking towards the headstock (when using a tuner that clips on the headstock) is just a personal choice.  Either way is o.k. with me as long as I can easily see the digital readout and it tunes my guitars accurately.  This tuner has a nice clear readout and I can use it without my glasses.  Turning it on and off is easy as long as you don't get clumsy and knock it off inside the guitar.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I like it, but I would prefer it to fit a bit more snug, and tune down to 432.  Plus, a battery cover to keep the battery extra secure would be nice.  It does tune well and quickly and is easy to see the readout.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: 5.25.16 - I am lowering the star rating from 4 to 2.  I have been having problems with this tuner and now it won't work at all.  It will turn on and display 440, but when I try to tune a string the tuner begins to flash and will not stop.  It started doing this about 2 weeks ago but would then begin to tune but now it will only flash and is useless as a tuner.",

  "text":"I had excitedly received this item in the mail and immediately went to testing it out since I had never printed on Vinyl before. I compared it to my regular glossy sticker paper and although it is whiter than my sticker paper (I have had my previous sticker paper for a few years so slight yellowing has occurred), the adhesive is terrible, barely sticky at all and after I made a test print I sprayed some water directly on both sticker papers and the \"vinyl\" immediately sucked up all the water and discolored like any regular paper that absorbs water. I made sure to print on it with my laser printer so there wouldn't be any bias as to whether it was just ink smearing, so it definitely is NOT waterproof and definitely NOT vinyl. I work with vinyl quite often with my cricut and this \"vinyl\" tears just like regular paper and just sucks up water. It is just a glossy regular sticker paper. Even my old sticker paper barely absorbs water and the adhesion is very strong. I'm not returning this because I got it for only $11 but honestly, save your money for a better sticker paper.<br \/><br \/>TLDR, NOT VINYL and NOT WATERPROOF.",

Gas filled are a much better choice, since they not just help to absorb the energy from road irregularities, but also pushes the suspension up making the ride way more comfortable and even, and definitely you will not feel the road in your hands or potholes in your head. As far as handling goes, same story, not even close to gas shocks, hard turns makes you wonder if truck is going to roll over, believe it or not, those extra pounds of force on gas filled shocks pushing up the truck, make a HUGE difference when comes to turns and breaking, straight turnpike like roads, that is a different story, they will work fine, city driving not so much.<br \/>other than that, they are quality shocks, behave decently (if you drive like a 90 years old retiree) budget shocks and easy installation.

Can't you see my condition&quot;, it took three esophagus transplants before the producer finally settled on the first take after all.<br \/>To say the lyrics to this opus are challenging is like saying Dubrow isn't the most folically challenged lead singer since Klaus Meine.  When singing &quot;Run for Cover&quot; on the first album, perhaps Dubrow was talking to a rhyming dictionary, cuz if he actually used one in penning any of these laughers, they probably would have come off as a little less imbecilic.  I do remember hearing once that many of the song lyrics were written either on napkins or toilet paper in the bathroom.  Considering their quality, I'd say both were certainly used for what they were intended for.<br \/>While such sophmoric lyrics as &quot;It's a human zoo&quot;, &quot;Turn it up til it bangs your head...tear it down and mama don't play dead&quot;, &quot;The bells, they are ringing... or is it in my head..... my nerves are not withstanding....... I'm falling out of bed&quot; and &quot;We were born to rock...pull out all the stops&quot;, would surely make any first graders parents proud, in this case we are talking about the efforts of a grown man.<br \/>Hearing Dubrow scream,&quot;We laugh with our masks on, the joke is on you&quot; could not summarize this album any more succinctly.

  "text":"I bought this amp new at GC back in 2011 I believe. It was my first big amp, so I was completely in awe of all the effects and settings that are featured on this beast. It pretty much gives you the same tone no matter what axe you are plugging into it since it is a modeling amp. My purchase came with the FBV Express MKII which is a footswitch that is compatible with Line 6 amps. After only about 7 or 8 months, the amp's power board gave up on me. I have gotten it tested by a few people who know what theu are doing when it comes to circuit boards and computers and they all say it is a power board failure. Let it be known that I used the amp as regularly as anyone else with the exception of leaving it on overnight ONCE months before the power failed. I noticed that when I plugged in the footswitch after a few months of use, that the amp would shut down by itself. This made me very reluctant when plugging in the footswitch. Usually when that happens I give the amp a few minutes to cool off then I start it up again. The last time I used this amp, I plugged in the footswitch and sure enough it shut down again, however this time it shut down for good. I went to GC to see if they could repair it and they told me no (Guitar Center is just a big business that like to make a profit by utilizing a musicians passion). Just recently we decided to take it into another Guitar Center since a friend of my dad worked there and he said that they could fix it but it was no longer under warranty. Line 6 hardly has any service centers in Southern California that are not a long drive away. They also don't have any replacement parts. This horrible experience has made me very cautious and skeptical about Line 6 products. I want to like them but the stress I have endured with this one occasion has ruined the name for me. Don't get me wrong, I do recognize the innovation that this company has set forth in the music industry, and Guitar Center is mostly to blame for my bitterness, however my story serves as the bad possibility that this amp can present.",

  "text":"I was eager to begin working through this book in the hopes of building a solid music theory background to begin composing music. I spent 4 months working steadily on it and finished the book in April. I am disappointed and feel like my time and efforts would have been better spent using other resources (for example, Kostka's Tonal Harmony, which I just borrowed from the library and which I find to be fantastic).<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/><br \/>- It's a book that requires your active participation, so you will be doing a lot of chord connecting exercises. This is a good way to approach the subject.<br \/>- You are constantly drilled in severely restrictive voice-leading principles, so that you will become very good at identifying (and avoiding) voice-leading errors such as parallel 5ths and 8ves, or failing to move the seventh (4) down by step (to 3).<br \/>- You will become very adept at identifying chords and analyzing them using Roman numerals.<br \/>- You will become very skilled in 4-part writing.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>- This is pure music theory. There are NO excerpts from the music literature. I find this to be a terrible way to study music theory, because it disconnects the subject from any practical application. It would be like studying architecture and design but never referencing any actual buildings.<br \/>- Everything is chordal, like hymnals, with hardly any non-chord tones (NCTs). In real music NCTs proliferate and some of the real analytical challenges lie in trying to filter out these NCTs to reveal the underlying structural harmony. Because it provides no experience in doing this kind of filtering, this book will only partly help you understand chord progressions in real music.<br \/>- Book design is archaic. Originally published in 1984 and not updated since. It looks like someone typed it on a typewriter and bound it together.<br \/>- Book organization is poor. Although the chapters themselves are of suitable length to be finished in one or two sittings, the organization of the material within is haphazard.<br \/>- There is a \"master\" reference chord progression chart in the back of the book which is totally unreadable. Ideally it would be a great reference to see your options for building chord progressions, but I find it completely confusing.<br \/>- Mastering music theory is difficult, but good luck trying to remember that \"such and such chord progression typically uses an ascending soprano of 5, 6, 7, 8\" or \"double the root of these chords, but double the fifth in these chords, except in these scenarios\". I was focused when studying this book and don't remember any of this.<br \/><br \/>Conclusion: if you want to learn how to compose music, choose a different resource that provides excerpts from the music literature so that you can see how composition actually works.",

Her moaning about not finding Mr. Right when she had so many other great things in her life made her seem closer to 18 than 30, and she lost my sympathy fast.<br \/><br \/>I did like Drew. He was interesting because he was the only character who showed occasional depth. The rest? Chick lit stereotypes: fabulous friend, bitter-over-men friend, assorted hot guys with glaring flaws, ditzy parents, uptight sister...<br \/><br \/>The author's writing style was bright and funny and had potential...in places. But it seemed scattered and frantic the rest of the time. I think another draft or two might have made it a much better book.<br \/><br \/>My biggest problem with the book is one I have with a lot of chick lit in general: the constant current-as-of-2006 pop-culture references. Jennifer Aniston, Destiny's Child, Parker Stevenson, even Charlize Theron? I have a hard time believing someone who reads this in 50 years is going to recognize most of the references. No wonder these books become dated so quickly! This one feels dated now, just five years after it was published. Just one or two throughout the book would make it a little more timeless, which I assume any author wants his or work to be.<br \/><br \/>Don't get me wrong: I love chick lit and read lots of it. But I love smart chick lit. Unfortunately, this didn't fall into that category, which disappointed me because I wanted to like it.

Once I got it programmed (you really have to read the instructions to figure out how to program it!!), it did control the hot tub fine, but I doubt it saved us any money in electricity usage - because the time it was off, the hot tub cooled down to the point that the electricity needed to reheat the tub to useable temperature made up for any savings.  Then the lcd display went out, and now the timer is useless, other than manually turning the hot tub on and off at the timer - which defeats the purpose of the timer.  Not worth the money!

You're better off working within the midi editor and watching things happen in the score editor by itself. It is completely unintuitive and extremely limited. No lyrics, no dynamics, and you have to buy a $400 upgrade to get more than 32 staves on the screen (if you work with Orchestra, and the fact you can't get articulations easily on screen, you quickly suck up 5 staves for one instrument, and wind up out of room).<br \/><br \/>You also have to consider the requirement of NEEDING a qualified hardware to function.  This means another $100 to $300 purchase.<br \/><br \/>The other issues I have are the dozens of bugs that make their way into the software. Good luck installing on a non-clean copy of Windows. It won't work well. After several installs I finally got the software to at least startup. But, this last project I did was a video... writing music to the background. Producing the entire 6 minute short video worked great. But, I wanted to render\/bounce only the last minute of the video as a 'preview' video...  what I got, without changing anything at all, was a 3 second difference in audio-visual timing. With an hour of trying to figure out what to do, I gave up.<br \/><br \/>Little bugs like this. Such as one install resulted in 'popping and cracking' via ReWire. Click on a note in score editor, and the first half a second of the sample is skipped, or sometimes it won't play at all. Another install, and it works fine.  You would also think that tools on screen would allow for easy clipping, shortening of clips, trimming, etc....  no. You get this fancy curser, but when you click and drag - oh wait! No dragging, it just pops up a window with a bunch of time code and asks you where you want to trim to... never seemed to work quite right either.<br \/><br \/>Who knows.<br \/><br \/>For an 'industry standard', PT8 is EXTREMELY over-rated. Sure, I now have a Delta10\/10LT, and recording 8 people at once is great and all....  but so many features are half-thought-out, or simply and plainly buggy beyond repair, this is NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.<br \/><br \/>I just wish I could get my money back... all 900 dollars worth (keyboard, $250 for hardware requirements, $250 for software, $400 upgrade thinking it would improve things).<br \/>----------------<br \/><br \/>After half a year of ownership, my opinion has changed very little.  As I work on some videos right now via ReWire, I have frequently had PT8 lock up my system, or in this last case, my audio \"buzzed\" out of control and it notified me that my CPU was out of power (which is bogus under normal use). I quit PT8, which managed to get my system back under control and audio working again, and Reason was still running perfectly as if nothing had happened.",

The headband has quite a bit of force applied when worn and the ear pads are a rigid fit with not much cushion. I give it a 2\/10 for comfort and a 6\/10 for sound quality. I highly recommend getting a fair set of headphones that use the standard 3.5mm - 2.5mm audio jack as these get louder than most USB headsets and most external DAC's do not have a USB input. I use a Creative Sound Blaster G5 DAC with my old ASUS Vulcan Pro's and it sounds great 8\/10 and the Vulcan's can be worn for 6+ hours without nearly any ear or head fatigue.

With PC games I understand there are so many hardware - software combinations that even with serious Quality Control Play Testing there's bound to be a few issues.  In two attempts at \"career mode\" both have ended in crashes.  Unacceptable for a console game.<br \/><br \/>The menu \/ game interface is bizarre.  It's difficult to figure out at first that the Associaton or multi-year league play mode is now a \"coaching career\".  The game plays a little video to explain \"what's new\" but leaves this detail out.  Then once in that mode the way rosters and so forth are grouped and what information is viewable in each is strange.  For instance, as you prepare to scout for the draft one key thing to know is which players' contracts are expiring.  It's no longer listed in the roster, it requires you go through a few extra steps to figure that out.  Then once you're in the draft unless you've memorized your team needs you have to back all the way out to see which positions have a real need.<br \/><br \/>There are a few other strange things as far as menus \/ user interface design decisions, but the player and roster management in the career mode is by far the worst offender.

Honestly, since I saw this \"movie moment\" in the actual movie in a theater when I was a kid, its image has disturbingly haunted my memory for many decades.<br \/>It's not exactly a wholesome scene, in fact it's a horrific experience for Luke.  Who wouldn't freak out after seeing your own dead-eyed disembodied head in a scary cave. And now...it's been memorialized in physical form...by way of a Funko Pop Star Wars movie moment that I now possess.<br \/>I was really hoping the Dagobah box would contain a \"Pop! Rides Yoda Riding Luke Skywalker\". I would have loved that and I think that would have appealed to a broader audience as well. Another movie moment idea...Yoda Raising Luke's Ship Out of the Swamp.<br \/>Anyway...the sticker and the sticky note pad are meh at best.  A total of 4 items. None all that thrilling.

Some of the features are nice but there is no &#34;bold&#34; option which would run the water through slower, saturating the grounds, more effectively and make a stronger cup. The only way I can get a halfway decent cup of coffee is to use espresso roast and the 4 oz setting which is their solution to that problem. So, needless to say my morning to-go cup of coffee requires 4 k cups and it is still on the weaker side for my preferences, especially for an espresso roast.<br \/><br \/>Auto-brew setting is pretty much useless since it only does one cup at a time - nice thought but really only a worthy feature if you actually only make a single cup or use a carafe (a feature this machine does not offer).  I will likely just go back to a regular coffee pot where I can set it and not have to worry about it until I am ready to pour.<br \/><br \/>One really annoying design flaw I would like to point out is that the drip tray, while it does come out, it is not attached to the brewer but sets into another smaller tray which is attached and cannot be removed. This limits the use of travel mugs. My 20 oz Yeti knock off barely fits under it and I have to set it in at an angle and then turn it upright because of that second tray.

They are super awkward and big, they are giant for my newborn and take up a lot of space.  They are a pain to wash, instead of just a bottle and nipple to wash with these you have to take it all apart and have the nipple, bottle, and bottom to wash.  The \"warmer\" is a dumb oversized bowl that you put warm water in to warm the bottles and is honestly just a waste of space.  The oz measurements on the bottle are wrong and I had to purchase a separate adapter to pump into the bottle from my spectra.  Which I don't recommend because the shape of these make pumping into awkward.  Also it's hard to tell how much milk is left in the bottle when feeding and the bottle has to be held at an odd angle to get all the milk down to the nipple when baby is feeding.  He takes in more air because of this and so has more uncomfortable gas which a mom never wants.

While the songs are all pretty and pleasant to listen to, I found the CD as a whole very disappointing and redundant.  Not one of the songs even attempted to showcase Emmy's amazing vocal range; the closest was \"Anymore\", but even that didn't fully capture the thrilling beauty of her voice.  I understood before I purchased the CD that this project wasn't intended to be classical or operatic in style, but still it fell very short of my expectations.  If I hadn't first heard her in Phantom and been made aware of her vocal abilities, I'm sure I would have liked it much better.  All in all:  it's a soothing Enya-style album, but too monotonous for me.  I hope that Emmy's next album does more to highlight the amazing vocalist she is. :)",

  "text":"I read several good reviews of the P220 mic, and only found some bad ones after ordering (of course). Complaints were about the uneven, harsh response in the upper mids to high end, and excessive background noise pickup. I'll have to agree. I had a difficult time EQ'ing this out with my three-section parametric, and looking at some independent response plots I can see why: multiple resonant peaks, bigger than the factory plots showed. For those new to this stuff, it's difficult to round out more peaks than you have EQ bands: squashes frequencies you want to keep. Compared this with an AT2035 which was similar, but more tameable via EQ, and a Rode NT-1 (not \"1a\" version). The NT-1 was much easier to dial in (pretty much a single, rounded rise in high end), and picked up far less background noise. I kept the AT2035 for when ambient sounds are the target, but the NT-1 is much, much easier to work with when focused on what's in front of it. More so than the published polar patterns would suggest. Maybe I got some odd ducks? Returned easily thanks to Amazon's policies!",

  "text":"I loved this thing at first - I bought it in August of last year, so I've had it about 10 months. About 2 months ago, it started asking me to clean it a lot more often - like every 2 weeks instead of around once a month, then a month ago, it needed cleaning every week. I found online that there's a 4 hour cleaning cycle you can run, if you hold the clean button down for around 15-20 seconds. So I tried that. Worked good, without needing a clean, for only a week again. Then I found that if you take the water reservoir off and hit the clean button it will basically skip the cleaning cycle. Okay, weird, but, okay. So I did that. Now I'm finding that EVERY time I run a cup of the &#34;travel&#34; size, it tells me it has to be cleaned. Can run other cycles just fine, but not the travel size. Guess I'll try just using other cycles for now.  I hated my Keurig because it wouldn't brew the right size cup, and sometimes wouldn't brew at all - but that was after 7 years, not 10 months!",

Constantly have to adjust your camera to see your path ahead. Save points are far apart. Time is essence. With people like me who has tons of game to play, I wanna finished one game and move on to the next one. With such unjustable difficulty level, I think I would $%^#king forego this game and move on to the next one. I do not intend to kill myself with such difficulty. The creators are Gods I know. But there are a whole bunch of gamers around the world who are not God Gamers!!! Who seek a sense of completing a game because they want to experience the thrill and the excitement of a great game like Ninja Gaiden. However this I can say is definitely not worth my time playing it. When you create a game, you wanna make sure that gamers who play it can complete the game so that they will have an awesome experience and if they feel like challenging themselves to a greater difficulty level, then they may do so at there own will. Games must be created with various difficulty level in mind. If they want to reach out to mass gamers, that is just what they need to do. People like myself aren't expert at games but enjoyed playing and completing it to experience something that could not be experienced in TV, movies or elsewhere. With games it is the only hope for me to explore the sci-fi and fantasy world beyond my imagination. And yet Ninja Gaiden has failed to do so and my only advice to gamers are if you have the time to spend playing over and over again where you got killed, then by all means go ahead, if not find another game that will make you feel happy and satisfied. Because I know I am moving on, PERIOD!!! With this I rest my case.",

After my initial project where it worked flawlessly I put it away until last week when another opportunity to use it presented itself. I got it out, decided on the staples I needed, and proceeded to load them. Stop right there. I should have taken an extra five minutes to reread the manual, but, like most guys I jumped right in with both feet like I knew what I was doing. What I did was load the staples in the wrong slot. Now, I recognized this immediately and attempted to remove them and in the process pulled the wound metal spring that keeps upward pressure on the staples loose. There is no simple process to hook the small S hook back. I'm guessing the entire mechanism will have to be disassembled to get it reconnected and as handy as I think I am, I'm not willing to make that attempt. What to do, then? Find a tool repair shop that works on Hitachi staplers.<br \/>AND THERE'S THE RUB! There aren't any. I searched for an authorized repair shop in a 500 mile radius from me and nada. That means a major hassle contacting the factory to get a return authorization number, the expense of shipping both ways and the cost of repairs.

  "text":"First off, I suggest anyone wanting this game, WAIT!!! It's too freakin' high and you'll be disappointed with a few things, so wait on it. That seems to be the general consensus. The new graphics are great! But it's overpriced and for everyone out there who were expecting to play this game while traveling to someplace without a internet connection, forget it. You have to play it via the internet only. HUGE MISTAKE.<br \/>  I picked up my copy yesterday like all loyal Blizzard Starcraft fans out there. It was like Christmas for me back when I was a kid. I couldn't wait to get home and rip that sucker open. Then things became abundantly clear for me. All that delays,  all the silence, no reviews, nothing coming out of the Blizzard camp except trailers I've been watching for 2 yrs and the promise of something new, something fantastic, and something that will make the original Starcraft look like Pong. Well, I'm still waiting to be impressed.<br \/><br \/>  I am so angry about this! I can't even articulate accurately what exactly I'm disappointed with the most. The lack of LAN playing is serious let down since it's how I first learned to play SC. The biggest disappointment has to be the lack of stand alone playing. We live in a time where there are gaming laptops out there that are nearly as powerful and fast as desktops. Being able to play this game anywhere is one of the things I was so looking forward to and now, I learn that that's not the case. Truth is, SC was the first game I ever played on a PC when I bought my first back in 98. (besides solitaire anyway) Staying up all night playing, spending entire weekends being a mindless zombie battling the evil swarm. Luckily, I had a treadmill. Anyway, this is bad, but not all bad. Still, it's getting 2 stars just because of the high price and dependency on the internet just to play in single player mode. I feel as if I paid [...] bucks so I could be told what I could do with what I paid for. This isn't like Blizzard and I gotta ask, what was the motivation for them doing this to their loyal fan base of their award winning games. Do they give out golden turkey awards for games ?<br \/><br \/>  One of the impressive things about most of Blizzard products is that I could always play by myself and be happy doing that. I could play anywhere, anytime as long as I had my trusty gaming laptop. What the hell were they thinking! You have to have an internet connection to play? That's ludicrous! No wonder they kept that tidbit quiet and kept all things quiet because there's now way in hell this game is going to win Game of the year. Blizzard betrayed their followers and loyal fans. So, I guess when my internet is down, I'll just have to play pong to keep myself entertained now. Needless to say, I won't be buying SC 3 or any of SC2 expansion packs unless the online crap goes the way of the dodo Thanks Blizzard.<br \/><br \/>  I'm a very patient person and I'm always positive by nature. The reviews of SC2 are pouring in and most of them aren't positive. I feel like I've been robbed though like most. I love the familiar feeling I get from the game, but I guess I just was expecting something groundbreaking, something spectacular, something new. Graphics are good, storyline is great, but the game is a huge let down over all. I guess I'll have to become a Microsoft game fan and hope they'll come up with a good new strategy game. Blizzard, you've lost a fan. Good luck gang.<br \/><br \/>  I'm no stock market analyst, but it's my guess that the money you've made from this game so far will take a sharp decline within the next week after this bad release. This rings of the recent iPhone 4 situation. I really hope someone from Blizzard is actually reading these reviews because and respond quickly about it. I don't think this will happen though.

This CD is lacking pretty much off of the elements that make the great DT CD's so memorable.  It's obvious that every member of DT is insanely proficient at their instrument, but this CD doesn't do much for them.  It, to me, sounds like it was recorded under water.  It's very muddy sounding.  The drums are tucked way in the background and have really no attack whatsoever.  Might as well be a drum machine.  I think that without Portnoy's artistic leadership and in-your-face drumming style, DT may sink further in nothingness.  I'm not saying Mangini doesn't play well, he does.  But Portnoy has something that's I can't describe, but I can hear.  I've never heard any other drummer have it.  Portnoy was right, the band should have taken a break to recharge then regroup with a fresh outlook.  THAT would have made for a wicked album.

  "text":"I really enjoyed the first book, Trickery and was looking forward to book two, Persuasion. I\u2019m still sorting out what I just read. It was so random sometimes and all over the place. An event would take place and never fully explained or picked back up later. It was like it was just thrown in and then forgotten. In book one Willa appeared goofy and clumsy, but I figured there was a reason for that and would be answered in book two, however she just became seriously stupid. Basic common sense issues went right over her head and the reader is supposed to believe Gods are attracted to her? Seriously? Yes, she was endearing at times, but not THAT endearing. It was just hard getting through most of this book because of how stupid the writer made her out to be. It\u2019s one thing to be a bit slow, but this was just so over the top that it took away from the good parts of the book and the storyline. There was no new character development at all and why are the books titled after one of the boys if the book doesn\u2019t develop his character more? This series began with so much potential, but seriously needs to get back to a plot rather than filler.",

  "text":"It is shocking that this is the most sold PC gaming magazine in the US. Now I realize why they have it wrapped in plastic at the stores: They don't want anyone to descry the low quality of their product.<br \/><br \/>The key problem with this mag is its low content. The most sold PC gaming magazine in Germany has over 250 pages per monthly issue, compared to 100 in PC Gamer. There are no bestseller or score charts, broken down by genre - so that the reader may make an informed decision to purchase a game (especially considering that most of the titles that occupy the pages are low-profile titles). The hardware portion of the magazine is four pages long - but length is by far not the only problem. There are not enough tables and charts (for benchmarks, noise, temperature, power consumption comparisons etc.). The PC recommendations are weak (unbalanced component performance, suboptimal cost-effectiveness, inconsistent in objectives), there are no recommendations for particular components, no charts that would compare them quantitatively based on a rating of quality. The verdict score is just a single number; there is no table that breaks down graphics, gameplay etc. -3 Stars for low content.<br \/><br \/>The second significant problem is the presentation. The color schema looks like something you would find in a daycare center. The use of fonts and other design elements is extremely inconsistent and fickle. When you look at the main title of a game review, you don't see the game's title; I don't like the style decisions of the editors at all. Since presentational style is subjective I will not deduct any stars for this.<br \/><br \/>Compared to European gaming magazines, PC Gamer displays an over-proportional amount of ads. However, because I got the subscription for a low price, I don't mind skipping ads, and I would actually be interested in buying a custom computer from one of the advertisers, I did not remove any stars for the plethora of displayed ads.<br \/><br \/>With the performance of this magazine it is no wonder why print media is going to dust.",

  "text":"Ella James has potential.<br \/>I always start my reviews with the bad and end with the good. The bad? The writing. Ella darling, please don't rely on your husband anymore for editing and spend a little extra to hire an editor.  There's only so much sympathy an indie writer can get. Yes, your commas are all in the right place, but your sentence structure needs work! At times I became lost because I just couldn't follow what was being written. Since this is written in third person I didn't understand that childish narrative. Yes, it's a YA - but it was written more like first person pre-teen. Please give your YA readers more credit on language and sophistication, they seek it! We seek it!<br \/>Julia was endearing in Stained but I completely lost her in Stolen. She becomes whiny, indecisive, and just an annoying brat. I don't like the Harry Potter reference, because as another reviewer says, it seems like cheating on description. The story was FAR too short and should've been tacked on to Stained instead since that one was short as well. This would have made a nice size book. Stolen seems rushed and not well thought out. There were too many disconnections throughout where things didn't add up.<br \/><br \/>For the good. The storyline is fantastic and original. I love nephilim stories and really wished we got more from this one. I feel like the story itself has a ton of potential and I'll be keeping an eye out on James writing career. I really do hope this series gets picked up by a traditional publisher that can do it some service that it deserves. If it gets rewritten and cleaned up it'll be a hit all the way across. James has conquered the hardest part of writing and that's finding a story that we want to get lost in and this is that story.",

I'm now using a funnel to make sure 100% of the water goes in the right direction.<br \/><br \/>Under normal operation, the coffee chute that goes from the grinder to the filter must be cleared out very regularily or else the coffee will cake up inside there and the coffee won't make it from the grinder to the filter.

The illustrations are really nothing more than grainy black and white photographs of a lady's long fingernails pointing out salient details. In reality there is very little to see which will teach anyone the technical details which are so important to any student wishing to know more about this trend setting pistol<br \/>It really needs precise drawings and cross sections as to explain how the trigger and striker system works.

This is repeated in another layer on the other side.  When you sit on it, these layers get squished down.  You end up sitting on these overlapping layers of material. Since they are squares, each one has four corners that lay oddly over other layers. The longer you sit on it, the more they dig into your backside and become pressure points. If it had a foam layer to cover the gel squares, that would help alleviate some of the pressure points that form.<br \/><br \/>It works fairly decent to fold up and use on bleachers at sporting events for an hour or two, but gets pretty painful if you use it on an office chair over the course of the day.",

  "text":"The premise of this piece, and I assume the entire `wage theft' concept, is invalid. It assumes that wages are linked with productivity, or that wages should perpetually be linked with productivity, and this is just not a fact within the bounds of economic reality. While it is true that in the past productivity and wages were correlated, this was only the case because productivity and employee value were in close relation. This, however, is no longer the case.<br \/><br \/>Two centuries ago ten women could make ten blankets in ten days. Today, ten women are not as limited as they were in the past. Ten women might have access to ten machines that can create ten blankets every ten minutes. Technology vastly increases an individual's productivity. This book and the `wage theft' concept are aware of this, which is good because it's a first step.<br \/><br \/>The invalidation of the concept comes from the basic laws of trade. Trade is an exchange of value. Labor creates value for an employer. The employer trades money for the value that the employee provides. (Money is [supposed to] represent value. Rather than bartering what we value, we use money. When one has enough money, or accumulated value, one can exchange it for something of equal value.)<br \/><br \/>Value, of course, is subjective, but its subjectivity is predictable within a free market. When anyone can push a button and make something happen, their value to their employer is very low. Therefore, wages will not mirror productivity. Productivity is not dependent on an employee's value anymore. In fact, I would argue that the flat-lined or slightly declining wages are a generous consequence of their employer's expanding profits. In actuality, if economics were to work in the absence of manipulation, I can assure you, most of the jobs today would pay much, much less. However, this would spur innovation and progress, and things would equalize. (I don't think the employer's overcompensate consciously. It's likely a result of laws or some other form of coercion.)<br \/><br \/>This is an explanation and an attempt to enlighten you. You may think or believe or want pay to be inseparable from productivity, but that is irrelevant. The effort put into labor is not relevant. The time put into labor is not relevant. Fairness and equality are not relevant. The rules of trade are unbreakable. They can be bent via force, but it ends in an imbalanced trade, which can be defined as irrational, and irrationality leads to violence and a compromised system.<br \/><br \/>So, anyway, yes, you can argue `wage theft' if it seems fair to you. But it is a lie. It is a lie people tell themselves to justify tipping a trade in their favor.",

Which is nice, but I don't plan on feeding my cat an entire bags worth of treats every month no matter how much she begs and it's the main reason why I cancelled. If they create an option to get everything but the treats, I would consider resubscribing.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: 5 stars --> 3 stars. We adopted a second cat and decided to resubscribe after a year away. I'm pretty disappointed with the multi cat box. The items claims to be $4-$5 a piece but I call shenanigans. What we received is no where near worth the $30 price point in terms of quantity or quality. I'd pay maybe 20.00 for what we received, but no more than that. My primary complaint regarding the treats still stands. Even with two cats, we don't need a full bag of treats every month but I can understand why some would.

  "text":"I've had this unit for about a year and a half, and here's my take: For the price, you are getting a lot of I\/O. That's good. Setup is easy: Plug in, download the drivers from the Behringer site, and you're up and running. I use the UMC1820 with Ableton Live 10 Standard and Windows 7 64-bit. This was an upgrade for me from a Tascam interface, which was causing a lot of latency and drops when using Ableton. After much frustration and talking with Ableton, they indicated the interface is the issue, so I upgraded to the UMC1820. I also added an ADA8200 earlier this year.<br \/>Here's the problem: I still have latency and dropouts when using Ableton. I didn't at first, but it has \"crept in\" over the last year or so. It makes no difference whether I am running a few VSTs, FX, and outboard gear, or just running Ableton by itself. I have uninstalled and re-installed the Behringer drivers, making sure I have the latest (I work in IT so I'm pretty good with this stuff). I reached out to Abelton support again, and...again....they pointed to the interface as being the issue with drops, crackling, etc. Here's the kicker: when I use the laptop as a stand alone (without the UMC connected and just using basic ASIO drivers), there are no drops, no latency, no issues.<br \/>I'd like to stick with the UMC1820, but I'll probably bit the bullet and fork over the $$ for a Focusrite. I'll keep the ADA8200 (it had it's own issues, ADAT link port broke after one time of changing the cable, fortunately it was replaced under warranty). The UMC1820 is good at giving you a lot of inputs, and it's very easy to set up and use, but I can't recommend it.",

Examples:<br \/><br \/>I am a vegetarian, but I keep getting boxes with beef jerky sticks. No option in my profile to mention dietary preferences; which is one thing for me, but what about people with food intolerances (they send peanut butter!) or religious restrictions??<br \/><br \/>Another example: I don't appreciate the pandering to me, as a female, with fancy smelly sprays and scented wipes and \"face refreshing spray\" -- seriously? I want what the guys got (you often get different items if your box is for male or female). And maybe the guys wanted the fancy smelly wipes. But Gainz doesn't ask, they just assume. Why did I get whey powder this month and the guys got pre-workout?? Huh???<br \/><br \/>I think the last straw was getting a unisex tshirt (from Hybrid Performance). In the account profile, you specify not just size but, as I mentioned, also gender, so that you can get the fit you want. Are you a girl who likes longer, looser tshirts? Go with a guys size. Are you a guy who wants flowy tank tops? You can choose a girls size. So WHY are we getting unisex anything? We pay a premium to get premium cuts, not the run-of-the-mill cuts. And, I did a little digging -- Hybrid Performance DOES make women's cut shirts...just not the one Gainz Box sent. Hmm.<br \/><br \/>My subscription is halted until I can see spoilers in time to decide each month if I actually want what they're sending anymore. Going in blind is only worth it if you can use a BOGO code -- look for those on social media -- that way, if only half the stuff in each box is good, at least you got a full box worth of good stuff. :)",

Of the 5 or so things we've tried, 2 were good, 1 was interesting, and 2 were meh. I expect the rest of the items to have a similar mix of results, and I'll be sure to mark down the \"good\" ones and try to find them at my local Japanese grocer.<br \/><br \/>Even if every item were good, I think the regular box price would be on the 100% not worth it side of the scale. At 20-25 items per box, with some of those items being tiny, it comes to $1.56 to $1.95 per item. I typically expect more than your money's worth for mystery type boxes like this, and it's hard to see that being the case here. Needless to say, I won't be continuing my subscription.",

Apart from that, it took forever to receive. It was over two weeks from the point of ordering it, that I received it.<br \/><br \/>Regarding the packaging, I expected it to be difficult to manage. I have a hard time opening things that say &#34;pull here.&#34; Curiously, the package tore open very easily, and it wasn't a problem at all.<br \/><br \/>That said, as soon as it was unsealed, I was hit with a big face full of garlic. I'm a moderate garlic fan. It's an accent flavor in my kitchen, not the show stopper. The smell was so overwhelming I had second thoughts about trying  the soup.<br \/><br \/>Still, I microwaved it for about a minute and it was perfectly warmed. I fully expected to be knocked down by garlic. Instead, I tasted nothing at all. I thought maybe with the first bite I'd missed some vital components, so I took another bite. This time I made sure I got kale, beans, chicken, and a bit of tomato. Nothing. It was all this flat, generic canned food flavor.<br \/><br \/>I am very disappointed in this soup.

The file surfaces seem to cut well, it\u2019s just frustrating when the handles are loose or crooked. Instead of flat handles that line up with the flat blade, they should have used round handles so it wouldn\u2019t matter how they were installed. These are not cheap files, and I expected better quality. Unlike some of my old Nicholson files that were American made, these are marked made in Brazil. I understand that manufacturers have to produce their products globally, but it\u2019s a shame when a great American file manufacturer like Nicholson has to sacrifice quality to compete with low quality imports.

He is 8 months old now and under the weight limit.  He had dropped one of his toys that he was playing with while in the jumper.  He leaned over to get it and leaned a bit too far causing the seat to turn over and he was dangling by his legs,  I thought perhaps that it was because I had the seat down too low so I raised it as high as it would go and kept an eye on him.  Within 10 minutes, he dropped another toy, leaned over to get it, and just about flipped the seat again (I caught him this time).<br \/><br \/>I really hate to give this product a negative review because both of my kids loved it so much, but it is potentially dangerous even when used properly.",

  "text":"It is important to say that Newsweek has an overall good balance of world and national news. If you want to obtain a magazine that will give you a basic understanding of different world developments, and I repeat \"basic understanding\" this is a safe bet. Nonetheless, most of the articles found in Newsweek will not give the reader an in depth analysis of the topic at hand and in most cases will be very superficial. For example, in Newsweek articles dealing with poverty conditions in Somalia and Rwanda, the magazine fails to mention how the United Nations and the United States have failed to successfuly address the problem. In articles about genocide in East Timor, the magazine fails to tell you that the weapons that were used by the Indonesian army to commit genocide were provided by the United States and that the United States used its veto power at the security council to prevent sanctions on Indonesia. In other topics such as the economic crisis in Argentina, the magazine fails to tell the reader about some of main factors leading to the crisis such as the incredible corruption of Argentina's previous government. To conclude, get this magazine if you want a basic source of global information. If you want a magazine that will give you real insight on world affairs, do not buy this magazine.",

In my opinion, that is unacceptable, it resembles a dead pixel line on my screen. I never had problems with standard screen protectors so I decided to toss tempered glass aside and I'm glad I did. These cover my whole screen and I have no liftoff issues. I gave it 4 stars because they are a bit sticky to the touch, but other than that it's the best one so far.

I don't realize I have engaged the gas until I smell it.  I'm on the short side and this happens even when I reach to stir a pot that is simmering on a back burner.  This is a serious safety issue.  I love the stove oven combo and want to see if anything can be done about the knobs.  I believe if the springs where stiffer they would not turn with a little bump from my body.

That doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t for someone else. Just not me. Which is a shame, because I am frequently drawn in by the premises of her books. They just fail on execution.<br \/><br \/>First, this book commits the cardinal sin of romcoms: the female MC is an idiot. It isn\u2019t even that she makes poor decisions. She actively works to be an ugly American stereotype as much as she can.<br \/><br \/>The female MC is dared by her friends to send a dirty text to her number neighbor, which was apparently a thing a few years ago. Then the number neighbor texts her a dirty text back and they start sexting each other. So far so good.<br \/><br \/>It turns out that the person she has been texting is her incredibly hot, British, next door neighbor. In a different genre, this might be silly, but this is a pretty common level of coincidence in a romcom. The problem I have is that so little time is spent on developing the sexting relationship, that having them develop a relationship in person doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. The male MC says that they have a lot in common so they should explore that in person. I don\u2019t think that was demonstrated at all.<br \/><br \/>Also, I think a lot authors believe that someone being rude and hateful means they are a \u201cstraight shooter \u201c who speaks their mind. Nope. It just makes them a jerk.

I am very surprised it isn't wrapped in anything fully. Powder was all over the package it came in. Kind of unsanitary.  Upon use it diminishes really quickly. The water was lightly colored.

  "text":"VMP offers yearly subscription for a cheaper price if you buy a year at a time. I also get a email notification from them and I can either skip the copy or get a previous copy to sell as they sell for a lot compared with most record clubs. It\u2019s more expensive, but they make the covers which are very thick and all of the pressings are exclusive and 180g pressings. Some are even 45rpm remastered. I know many people are going to say they don\u2019t like VMP or it\u2019s too expensive. But I like knowing what I am getting and have plenty of time to exchange it, or if I don\u2019t want a duplicate or something else, I will get a month\u2019s credit.<br \/><br \/>The one thing that Amazon has FINALLY made an improvement with is their packaging for vinyl.  The old method was absolutely terrible and I never purchased vinyl from Amazon because of this issue. I recently purchased two Phish LP on LP copies and discovered that they finally updated their packaging procedure!<br \/><br \/>Almost every album I would order, would arrive with either bent edges or corners, or worse, large seam splits or both! I can\u2019t say it\u2019s the post office every time either.  I returned a copy of Bob Mould - Workbook 25 because it had about 2 inches of the spine missing from poor packaging. Another issue I have had with Amazon and vinyl pressings is that in the past, I ordered two Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs pressings and they kept saying it wasn\u2019t in stock. I finally bought the two pressings from Music Direct, the owner of the MoFi label now, and canceled the Amazon copies. I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t have them in stock as they where not exactly low numbered repressings like some of the newer ones. However Amazon charged me for the crappy mp3 that they sent, instead of removing them. I don\u2019t do mp3 format! Yes that sounds like a snobbish remark, but it\u2019s a crude format!  It\u2019s why I have owned 4  Astell&Kern players over the years and I buy downloads that are in 24Bit\/192 kHz or DSD. MQA is an amazing sounding format as well and I own several MQA CDs that I have ordered from Japan! You need a computer and special DAC to unfold the true sound of these releases! I have some great downloads that are 24Bit \/96kHz as well. Amazon still charged me $9.99 each for the two albums they could have gotten and it was for a service I don\u2019t even use! I don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t have the copies in stock in the first place because everyone else online had them in stock!<br \/><br \/>My last complaint about buying vinyl pressings from Amazon is that third party sellers are not listing their used vinyl pressings in the correct place. Yes, I know this Vinyl of the Month subscription is different, but their used Vinyl and CDs is a complete mess! I have sent back several that were listed as a certain pressings only to get a different pressing! Some of these albums have upwards of 200+ pressings. Yet they let third party sellers list them just anywhere! I purchased a copy of Queen - The Game that was supposed to be a MFSL copy and NM. It had a photo of the MFSL album . I even sent an email to the seller saying that if it wasn\u2019t an MFSL issue, don\u2019t send it! Well I got a terrible US pressing that was dirty and had severe ring wear. I tried to contact the seller and he was gone with my $75.00.<br \/><br \/>I haven\u2019t purchased any Vinyl or CDs or SACDs from the third party sellers in a long time. I just got feed up with buying items that where listed incorrectly or the sellers idea of NM is much different than what the average person would consider NM, even to the people who have no clue about grading vinyl.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m going to post a question before I decide on weather or not this is a Record of the Month club I would want to be part of or is it not something I would like. So far the titles listed are copies I already have a few different pressings of. I\u2019m also not a huge fan of picture disc, as they sound terrible for the most part. I have two copies of Pink Floyd - The Wall, one is a Japanese pressing and the other is a MFSL pressing. I have 5 copies of The Clash - London Calling. A earlier Japanese pressing, a red unofficial version, a couple of U.K. pressings and I bought a Clear Vinyl 50th Anniversary release that I have not played or opened as it is worth over $450.00+ on Discogs. I got it for about $70.00.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m also a little bit put off by customers saying that they got a different copy for the month than others got. That never happens with VMP! So I will have to see what response I get to my question about these albums that are being sent out before I join another vinyl club!",

The water coming through the capsules never got higher than 170 degrees and sometimes lower. Lastly, when using the lower tray, the cleanup is not easy as the tray is not removable and has several 1\/4&#34;+ fins sticking up. Cleaning between them is difficult.

It's beautiful and I just finished reading Rebel Mechanics which was steampunk based and so I thought this was a good follow up to reading that. I was ecstatic that it was so highly steampunked but the characters fell flat to me.<br \/><br \/>We follow Eyelet and Urlicks POV. It's set in Victorian England where if you are afflicted with a mental illness you are shut away and of course only the rich are given an education and not girls. Poor Eyelet has seizures that come suddenly and so she has to hide it from everyone else. Her mother is accused of witchcraft and is killed-the only message her mother gave her was to run and to live! Eyelet knows that the only chance of her surviving is to find her dead fathers machine. She follows Urlick who she thinks has stolen it and they go on a merry adventure.<br \/><br \/>Eyelet was frankly annoying..she was awesome in the first two-three chapters but when she gets stuck in a house with Urlick and Iris she turns into a whiney teenager that gives no thought to others. She picks up everything and touches everything and never listens. She doesn't really get any better later on in the story except maybe towards the end....<br \/><br \/>Other characters were great and supportive-I really liked Iris! Also the romance...I felt like it was forced. You didn't need romance in a story like this. I felt like they were better as friends. The romance was awkward also at some points so I didn't care for it.

Even the choice of a lead singer for each tune was first individually auditioned and then voted on - an amazing, ego-free democracy.<br \/><br \/>No one ever mentions it in their reviews, but listen to \"Eli's Comin'\" to witness an incredible performance by Jessica Cleaves and the group.  They recorded this intricate vocal arrangment in an unbelievable one vocal \"take\".  Ditto for a one take performace of \"Grazin' in the Grass\".<br \/><br \/>On the other hand, \"Highly Distinct\" was always, and still is, highly unlistenable. My favorite cut is \"It's Just A Game\".  At this point in their career, the group had enjoyed back-to-back million selling singles and RCA asked (correction: DEMANDED) that a new album be produced immediately.<br \/><br \/>Well ... truth be told (as Harry Elston would say), the Friends had been on the road for months, headlined LA's Greek Theater with Tom Jones, and simply didn't have the time to put something special together for a follow-up LP.  And most of the cuts had to be recorded live with a full orchestra because RCA didn't want us to spend time cutting individual sets of tracks as we had done for \"Grazin'\".<br \/><br \/>Thus, in a perfect world, RCA could have\/should have released \"I Really Hope You Do\" (the \"B\" side of \"Grazin' in the Grass\") as the Friends' follow-up single to \"Going in Circles\" and allowed the group MUCH more time to put a sensational new album together.  However, as it turned out, this wish was granted a year later (though I was no longer affiliated with the group), when Ray Cork produced the \"Real Friends\" LP.  THAT album should have been the followup to our \"Grazin'\" LP - not \"Highly Distinct\". (And, had RCA released \"It Don't Matter To Me\" instead of \"Time Waits for No One\", I believe the Friends' string of monster hits would have been extended.)<br \/><br \/>Friends of Distinction fans: I recommend the \"Grazin'\" and \"Real Friends\" collections as the very best of this talented group's performances.",

So let\u2019s talking packaging, it was wrapped in plastic, so that was a disappointment. I can also confirm that the tin does rust. As far as the product goes, it was too oily to use as a regular conditioner\/detangler. I tried only using it once a month but had to switch to once every two-three weeks. It is great as scalp moisturizer but not great for detangling.",

If i'm doing the chapter one questions there really shouldn't be anything about BCP\/DR or security frameworks...those are domain 7 and 2 respectively.  Yes I should know them (and do) but it's not helpful for trying to focus in on an area if that area is all over the place.  As for the questions themselves they are either RIDICULOUSLY easy or insidiously confusing and ask about things I've *never* even heard of before in my 20+ years of IT and after reading 4 other CISSP texts (including the officially sponsored ones) and watching both Lynda.com and Cybrary.com lectures.  The explanations are very handy however so you can see exactly why the other answers are wrong and learn what tripped you up.",

  "text":"I purchased these masks since the 3M version is currently not available to the general public.  While I do like the material and the elastic cords that attach to your ears the mask has two fatal flaws.<br \/><br \/> The first being the metal nose piece that should comform to the bridge of your nose once bent, the material is too flimsy to form any kind of effective seal around your nose leading to air gaps in the mask.  This is pretty annoying since every time you exhale it blows into your eyes causing a slight tickle.<br \/><br \/>The second flaw seems to be the masks exhaust port which seems to serve little to no purpose.  On the interior of the exhaust port there is a plastic stopper that is supposed to keep the flap from opening too much but with this mask the stopper is firmly placed right against the flap not allowing it to open at all during exhale.  If I firmly seat the mask around my face bypassing the nose piece it is pretty difficult to exhale since the exhaust port is blocked.<br \/><br \/>I'm not really sure what to think of these masks and if they are a safe option, not just for working around the house but for any type of covid protection.  The material the mask is made from might be N95 comparable but with the un-functionable material in the nose piece there are some serious air gaps in upper portion of this mask.",

  "text":"This is actually a review for vols. I and II.  Just in general, Gould's style is fantastic for some of the sonatas but is really inappropriate for others.<br \/>His portamento (detached) presto\/prestissimo playing makes the \"Tempest\" sonata the best version I've ever heard but really makes the \"Pathetique\" seem rushed and totally without feeling.<br \/>I mostly bought vol. II for the last 3 sonatas (op. 109, 110 and 111).  I figured the most unusual and most \"un-Beethovanic\" of the sonatas deserved the most unusual interpretation, and I wasn't disappointed.  They are clear and with good \"diction\", fast where appropriate but also slow and legato where melodic and flowing.  Even in the most technically difficult sections Gould, in typical contrapunctal style, weaves the different voices in and out of the melody holding to his philosophy that \"Every voice is important\".<br \/>Probably the most disappointing of all the recordings on these 2 sets is the \"Appassionata\".  Playing it through at practice speed does nothing for the passion, depth and beauty of this piece and only serves to exemplify Gould's hatred for it.  (Typically, if Gould hated a piece, he would play it through either blindingly fast and without regard for dynamics or lethargically slow to heighten its inferiority and \"boringness\".<br \/>The \"moonlight\" seems a little fast, esp. the first movement, but it might be Gould's literal interpretation of 2\/2 time.  The 3rd movement is at breakneck speed that some people might like.<br \/>I actually prefer the romantic-style playing of R. Serkin, Brendel and Horowicz for this piece.<br \/>Listen to the 2nd movement of the #13 where the left and right hands are playing parallel arpeggios.  In the 1st section the notes are played together but in the second section the hands are staggered by an 8th (the left hand plays the note 1\/8th before the right).  I have never heard a piano make that kind of ethereal echoing sound and, I suppose, it probably cannot be reproduced without the kind of fast detached playing that only Gould could do.<br \/>So, no one recording artist has the best performance of all the Beethoven sonatas.  With Gould, you'll get excellent interpretations of some of the lesser known works and less adherence to the romantic style of the better known \"named\" sonatas.",

  "text":"I understand that it took Ledger 10 years to write this book. The first thing that came to mind upon hearing this is that there was not enough passion for this project and if that was the case, it showed. The characters seemed very one dimensional. Ledger does show glimpses throughout the story of the deeper aspects of each of her primary characters. The problem is she stops short and never delves beyond that point. If she had taken one aspect of the story such as the chronic pain angle or Emily and Simon's faltering marriage or even the tragedy of losing their first born and focused on that instead of messily trying to link all these major themes together in one book, she probably would have written a much better story. There was just way too much going on in one novel, so much so that that it was painful to read. Emily is having an affair, her daughter is displaying completely contrary behavior toward her mother. Her husband is attempting to launch a new hobby both time consuming and expensive and which he knows nothing about while he is running a successful medical practice and also running an illict new drug trial for a medication he knows nothing about nor has bothered to research. The ending does not do any kind of job tying together the loose ends that are just left flapping in the breeze. Ledger really needed to finish this book before setting it loose on the world.",

With that in mind, it only uses point-to-point wiring instead of a printed circuit board, so mistakes are fairly easy to fix. The directions are good, although not perfect - there wasn't enough info on how to read resistor and capacitor values.

However, all in all, this was my second pedal build (after a Build-Your-Own-Clone kit) and it worked the first try without any debugging.<br \/><br \/>My only major complaint about the kit is it's too bare-bones to really be useful to a gigging musician.

I will get a set of pens like these, store them horizontally, and keep them wrapped until the time I actually use them- which was the case with my Lime Green. I bought this set in April- had no need to use my lime green until today. When I unwrapped and primed the pen, the paint did not absorb into the tip as all the others have done, but rather just laid on the surface of only one side of the tip. No matter how I tried or waited for the paint to permeate through the tip, it did not, it simply just \"blobbed\" down off the side of the tip. It was almost as if the tip had some sort of coating on it preventing the paint from reacting with it the way the others have.  Granted, I do have the rest of my set, and I love the colors, but am disappointed that I've lost one of the set due to a faulty tip.

  "text":"I saw one of these in a local pet store &, as a tropical fish nut, just had to get it for my American Eskimo puppy. They happened to have the glow-in-the-dark one. My Eskie loves it but only gets to play with \"Fishie\" during relatively brief, outside play sessions, because it won't stand up to continued chewing. (It's also great for outside because grass, dirt, etc rinses off instantly).  He's already chewed off the anal fin & the tips of the tail fin...the fish is made out of a rubbery plastic sort of material that I like because it's not hard on his baby teeth, but don't like because he can chew bits off. It's not easy, & the bits tend to come off slowly, starting with a crack, so I've been able to remove the pieces myself without him swallowing them. I dunno if they'd hurt him if he did --sorta soft, no sharp edges-- but don't want to take the chance.<br \/><br \/>He also loves to pounce into & just generally attack water (I made him a sort of baby pool out of a rubbermaid-type under-bed storage container), & he really had a great time leaping into the 'pool' to attack the floating fish. We've had some fun night-time play sessions due to the glow-in-the-dark aspect. The glow fades after a while but is renewed to a very bright glow after just a minute under a lamp.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line, I (&my dog) love this toy but wish it were sturdier. I'm sure really butch chewers like large dogs, bulls, chows, etc would bite thru them very quickly. Although my 4-month-old Eskie seems to have a bite like an alligator, I'm sure he doesn't compare with bigger jaws!

  "text":"If you are a tank or a mage character, you might not have the necessary passive skills and base dexterity to perform this shell swap, either respec, or find another player who has maxed or near maxed dexterity. The ribbon cables, particularly the one connecting the inner shell on the right joy-con, require some finesse, as these things are pretty tiny and in some places are tight fits. Also make sure you have the right gear before starting this quest. low level screwdriver sets will strip your screw, and the game world only spawns the screws one time in your original joy-con shell, so once those are gone, they're gone. For any player accepting quests of this nature, I highly recommend investing in an ifixitkit. (the 64 bit set includes the tri-wing screwdrivers that you will need for Nintendo consoles. Seriously, anyone doing this should have it or an equivalent kit, they recently had a price drop so for anyone who takes stuff apart, its a no brainier.) Having bad screwdrivers and using them wrong will strip your screws. you have to apply a reasonable amount of pressure because the new shell will not have prethreaded holes, and these aren't exactly self-tapping screws.<br \/><br \/>as many other reviewers mentioned, there are molding issues with the right joy-con near the + button. Another user uploaded a review picture that has the problem area circled in red, their joy-con is clear green, so just search for that picture in the customer images, and then sand\/file that area down until it fits properly.<br \/><br \/>Because of the issues with the molding, I cannot recommend this as a *product*. I can, however, recommend this as a *project*. The clear outsides really don't look all that great without sanding them first, and the shell does require modification before it will fit properly. That said, you have to have reasonable expectations. This is, after all, an unofficial molding of a product that hasn't even been out for a full year at this point. Even though the molding isn't perfect, I really do have to say I'm impressed with it all things considered. the Joy-con shells have some fairly specific tolerances and really, its kind of amazing that this aftermarket product is here so quickly with only *one* major flaw.<br \/> If this is your first time shell swapping a Nintendo, id start off with a GameBoy or something first, there's a lot less to go wrong there.",

  "text":"Generally speaking, I agree with the most helpful reviews thus far, in that this book, much like the first in the series, is frustrating.  One reason people like to read books of this genre is to imagine how they would react in the situation presented.  Without going into details that other reviewer have already covered, somehow the protagonist manages to do nearly everything virtually opposite as I would have.  The overall premise of the story is fascinating and chilling.  The execution of telling the story is comical at times.<br \/><br \/>Whoever edited this thing is just as clueless as the author is concerning vehicles.  It seems odd that in this age of instant fact checking, no one connected with this book could have looked up a few basic facts.  For instance, the author mentions a Dodge Durango that weighs nearly one and one half tons.  Really?  How about between 4500 and 5200 pounds, depending upon year.  Perhaps the author just doesn't know how much a ton is.  Here's another one.  To quote from the book &#34;The tachometer said they had traveled a total of 107 miles&#34;.  Is that really what a tachometer shows you?  Nope, it is not.  My third example is a bit fuzzier.

  "text":"Robyn's returned with new music on 'Body Talk, pt. 1'. Something you may notice about this release is that it only contains 8 tracks. Robyn has said that she plans on releasing 3 of these mini albums through the year, with the second installment due out in September. That being said, I believe the length of this mini album (better called or considered an EP) is what makes it feel somewhat weak. 'Body Talk, pt. 1' feels a bit scattered: there's no real consistent theme or concept that pulls the tracks together. Each track is a different style and experiment of sorts, meaning there are tracks that really stand out and feel great while others leave much to be desired.<br \/><br \/>The Good: As stated, there's a lot going on sound and style wise on this 8 track release. The first track \"Don't Tell Me What To Do\" is different from anything considered pop music today. It's basically an entire track based around complaints and laments. While it's devoid of any real singing, it's a catchy track due to it's lyrics that will have you laughing and both relating to Robyn. \"Fembot\" is probably the best track from the album: it's very electronic with layers of mechanical sounds enveloping Robyn's raps where she describes herself as a new generation model computer suffering from heartbreak and angst. It's definitely the Robyn we're all familiar with and stylistically unique. There are other songs worth noting from the single \"Dancing On My Own\" which is an upbeat dance ballad, \"Cry When You Get Older\" which is somewhat reminiscent of Frankie Valli's music, the reggae-influenced \"Dancehall Queen\", and the stripped-down love ballad \"Hang With Me\". In all, there's a lot of different genres of music crammed onto this short release that'll give fans and casual listeners something they will like.<br \/><br \/>The Bad: Here's my gripe with the album - with only 8 tracks, there really should be no fillers and each track should be single worthy and exceptional. That's not the case with 'Body Talk, pt. 1'. In a way, I feel like it's a ploy to get away with making more money off of one album. You get the sense that this release is a bit incomplete and unfinished because the songs don't really flow together well, the album feels like a music sampler and there are just some tracks that don't measure up, making you feel like even at a low price you're paying too much for all of the songs. \"Dancing On My Own\" is just okay, but probably comes off better in its music video form than it does within this lineup of music; I could barely make it through \"None of Dem\", \"Dancehall Queen\" feels a bit like an unfinished demo and while pretty and typical of Robyn, the foreign language track\/ballad \"Jav Vet En Dejlig Rosa\" just feels out of place considering 6 of the other tracks are all dance\/pop. Yes, more new music and 'parts' of this album will come out in the near future but with this being the only volume released thus far, it feels very incomplete and unfocused.<br \/><br \/>In all, average, if that. I'd personally not feel comfortable recommending someone purchase the entire album because not all of the tracks are worth buying or listening to more than once. I hope that the future volumes of this album released are better put together because this one feels like a collection of random songs or demos - and that's not Robyn's usual standard or quality of work.<br \/><br \/>Listen to These: \"Fembot\", \"Hang With Me (Acoustic)\", \"Don't Tell Me What To Do\", \"Cry When You Get Older\"",

I was initially concerned the leash would break after being vigorously rubbed against trees, gates, walls, corners, etc, but it is strong material. Think of the stuff seat belts are made from, only thinner and narrower. This leash has been used for an 80-85 pound pit bull mix. It holds up just fine, even when he spots walking cheeseburgers (cats) in the vicinity and tries to sprint after them. I've dropped it a few times without any problems. I have several other leashes (a cord leash instead of a tape leash, a double leash for two dogs, and another tape leash) and this is the best. The other tape leash has failed after less than a month. This one has over 700 hours of use on it, and seems to have at least that much more. (roughly 6 months times 4-6 walks per day times 45-90 minutes per walk.)<br \/>  (edit: It's been almost 2 years since the 10-1-10 review. I have bought 2 of these (got another large dog) and both are still working fairly well. One of them was used as a chew toy by yet another dog; it damaged part of the handle, but the device still works. It just looks banged up now. I don't buy leashes to win fashion shows, I buy them to keep a dog within range of me when outside. The other one developed a small fray about 8 feet from the end. I trimmed it with some ordinary scissors, and that's that. Still works mostly fine. The one minor fault is that at times the cord doesn't retract fully. If I pull it out completely and let it feed back in, that sometimes works. Other times it clears up by itself. Not a big thing; I just like having the cord taut. I wouldn't deduct a point for this, so I'm leaving the original rating as is. If the (first) leash had 700 hours over that 6 months, it now has about 5 times that much, so 3,500 hours.<br \/>  I have noticed that on a shorter leash, the dogs walk a bit faster and stray less. They wander on lawns and up pathways more when they have the leeway this leash allows them (26 feet versus 8). That's okay, I want my dogs to have the most freedom possible and this helps allow that.)<br \/>  edit\/update: 9-3-16: After about 6 years, the leash is losing its struggle to maintain tautness. The cord will pull out and then either flop or slowly drag back partway, so that about 6 feet of cord still dangles outside the hand-unit. That doesn't help if I'm trying to keep my dog from going into the street if a car is close by, or from going up to a person if that person is (or appears to me to be) afraid of dogs. I'll try to figure out where and how to return these leashes, since I've heard there may be warranty issues. I'll update again when\/if I get repaired leashes or get blown off. For now, modified 5 stars down to 3.",

  "text":"I received this ukelele as a Christmas gift from my wife and I enjoy it. I am a beginner, and it is prefectly adequate for my level. She has a mid-level uke (Kala KA-SMHT-SC) I got from a local shop which contrasts some of the places this instrument has some room for improvement. In the end, it is clearly on the lower end of \"mid-level\" ukes. We've now bought 4 ukes from Amazon with the other 3 all laminates and this compares well with those.<br \/><br \/>As an aside, if the only ukeleles you've seen are the ones available on Amazon, you might have the impression that this is a high end ukelele. If you go to a quality music store, you will find that this instrument is fairly low on price (if you start with solid wood), but a comparison would show it is equally lacking in sound quality and fit & finish. That being said, for a wannabe player like me, who wants an instrument that sounds good enough that I'm not going to put it down in frustration it's decent without breaking the bank.<br \/><br \/>The good: It's a solid wood instrument, fairly well balanced with pleasing colors and glossy finish (which many purists might object to, but I think looks sweet). The tuners do stay in tune well and I kind of like the exposed brass gears on black metal though they're not as nice as solid brass. It sounds better than my daughters laminate by quite a bit as every solid wood will. Two knobs for straps, through the bridge strings and slotted headstock add more touches of flair. Quite a nice gig bag too (~1\/4\" medium density foam).<br \/><br \/>The mixed: while it clearly sounds better than laminate (and if you are upgrading from laminate it's a very big improvement), it is noticeably less full than my wife's and others I have used. You can really feel the difference against your body between it and nicer instruments. The neck shape is not as nice\/smooth. It's sort of a rounded rectangle and the more half-oval side shape does feel much nicer. It's like it's easier to pivot and slide along -- like your hand position and grasp is identical regardless of where on the neck you are holding. The width of the fretboard is also considerably wider with the G & A strings a strong 1\/8\" further apart than my wife's. I suppose my longer, thicker fingers might consider that a benefit, but honestly hers is more comfortable. It is consderably heavier than a fine instrument. The wood is thicker\/blockier, but in a way that just adds weight, not strength or shape. The body is thinner (less lower-end sound) and has a completely flat back where many nicer ones are shaped or curved. The action is low, which means you can make your chords without excessive pressure or effort (nice for the newbies who don't have callouses built up yet). However, it is perhaps a hair too low and my (likely poorly executed) strumming often involves grazing the neck. It's not particularly noticable, but the tones are just clearer coming off nicer instruments.<br \/><br \/>The bad: The frets are not smoothed or fit particularly nicely. Mine are actually sharp and extend a little bit too far. It definitely requires filing\/sanding, which does not appear easy to do without marring the finish and restringing. While I have not been cut, and doubt you actually would cut yourself, it is unpleasant. By contrast, I can slide up and down my wife's Kala and it's perfectly smooth. I've done it (slowly) on this one and I feel like I'm just asking to get snagged and cut. I consider the block\/flat neck close to bad as even my daughters cheap laminate isn't so clumsy, but I already listed it in the so-so.<br \/><br \/>In the end, it's one of the nicer ukes on Amazon. You can certainly learn and dabble on lesser instruments (I have been), but those are closer to toys -- made to be disposable and cheap more than quality instruments. This is an instrument, but an inexpensive Chinese import. Some corners were cut, and my fingers so far have not been. If you go to a local shop you'll find much nicer ones out there for not considerably more (those some are!). This price point is kind of in between the low end and mid levels and so the quality matches.",

  "text":"Overall I like the usability of this meat thermometer.  The app is well designed and comes with a lot of pre-configured temps (measuring preferred doneness) of a wide variety of meat types.  You get a chart that shows you the progress of the internal temps as well as a customizable alarm when a desired temp is reached.  It is small, sleek, and gets the job done.  The temps this device reports appear to be accurate (confirmed reported temp with other thermometers).<br \/><br \/>I have three complaints that have left me searching for an alternative meat thermometer:<br \/>- The most disappointing critique is with the Bluetooth range. Given the set-up of my house, I do my meat smoking from my driveway.  As soon as I enter my house, I lose my signal.  When you stay outside, the signal stays strong and functions as expected.  I wish I didn't have to stay outside to be able to read the temp.<br \/>- The battery appears to run out quickly.  Given that it isn't a standard AA or AAA, it is annoying and more expensive to replace.  There isn't a clear on\/off button on this device, so it is hard to tell if it is truly turned off.  Even when I thought it was turned off (phone\/app wasn't picking up on the signal) the next time I pulled it out of storage it was dead.  This happened twice to me.  I now completely remove the battery to make sure it doesn't drain out.<br \/>- The last negative, and I knew this going into the purchase, but I didn't realize how much I would rather have a temp read out on the device next to the smoker.  I don't always carry my phone with me, so it isn't as handy when you can't walk up to the smoker and see the temp.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I think there are better options for meat thermometers in the marketplace. Depending on how much you are willing to spend, the iGrill2 may be worth the extra cash.  It appears that the upgraded model would resolve most of my complaints.  However, I have recently purchased a Maverick ET-733 to replace this unit.  I am excited to see how it stacks up next to the iGrill Mini.",

  "text":"This gate is great for the fact of its size<br \/>for larger door frames, and its price. However, putting it together...you have to push a rod thru the top and bottom parts of it, and they have rubber ends on them, and CLOTH on the inside of the areas you have to push them thru, making it veryyyy difficult to do so!! They dont just SLIDE THRU, they get hung up. At one pt i was thinking it haddd to be sewn shuttt midway thru it. Would have made more sense to have put a nylon inside those areas, to make that part easier. It works great once together. Different system than ive ever seen, you have to twist ends of the top and bottom bars, to make it longer or shorter, to hold itself in the doorway. Kind of awkward, in my opinion. But once up, its sturdy. Prob is.... each time you have to move it, you have to repeat the twisting process, and lining it up in the doorway. And when you MOVE the gate,  like to the side, out of the way, its very wobbly. Its a cloth\/mesh interior, which makes the blocked off area, which is nice, that a small animal can't get thru it, like it possibly could with a foldable wooden gate. It's pretty tall also, which makes it difficult to just step over. So, my suggestion, if you are going to constantly be needing to open or close the gated area, i would go with something that actually opens and closes, for more convenience. Pleased with the gate itself, and i purchased it becuz of its price also....just not as convenient for me, but that's what i get for trying to save a few dollars at the time. \ud83d\ude0a",

  "text":"Once again, living in the states, we never get to here when an iconic band from the 80's puts out a new record for reasons I don't understand. The 80's are alive and well, and I wish record companies would take note. Hey guys, OMD just played another sold out night at Terminal 5. Ka-ching ka-ching! But I digress. I only found out the Ultravox had released a brand new album because Simple Minds is on tour in Europe (and coming to play the states for the first time in over a decade) and the supporting act for them was Ultravox in support of the new album, \"Brilliant\". So of course I had to give it a go. I don't think there's a perfect Ultravox I can listen all the way through and this one's no different. I didn't know what I was in for especially given all the single word titles, maybe a concept album, who knows. One is immediately pulled into the opening track, \"Live\", with the classic cinematic keyboards and backing guitar arrangements and like an old friend, you hear Midge Ure's iconic vocals. I drew a comparison to David Lee Roth's vocals on Van Halen's latest album, \"A Different Kind Of Truth\" in that maybe he doesn't have the full range as 20 years ago which you sympathize, but there's no doubt both make the absolute most of what they got. The album has it's share of upbeat songs and many have some semi-religious undertones in the way Hymn had like in \"Rise\" which is actually overt and \"Live\". Then they have quick turnarounds with songs of melancholy and deep sadness with \"Remembering\" and \"Fall\". It's an album with a mix of multiple personality and attention deficit disorders. It's really good in spots but you never quite get the feeling what exactly they were shooting for as an end product. It's not a bad reunion album but it's not essential to the Ultravox catalog.",

And for the price, it's simply fantastic...<br \/><br \/>I had originally played my LPs into the computer just to save them and prevent any further wear, but this set kind of makes that unnecessary; the sound quality is excellent. The cover says \"Digitally Remastered and Enhanced for Superior Quality\", and it certainly sounds like it; I've heard several LP reissues that sound like they were recorded from the LP itself, complete with crackles and other surface noise...<br \/><br \/>My only negative about this set has to do with After The Riot At Newport... the guitar on several of the tunes (Relaxin', Riot-chous, others) is NOT Chet Atkins; being a huge fan of his since at least 1965 and hearing most of the recordings he's done, I think I can safely say Chet doesn't play jazz like this; he's not even on those tunes. The tunes he DOES play on are unmistakable.<br \/><br \/>Also, in trying to import these CDs into iTunes, CDDB, which is the online system that inserts the titles and other info into your MP3s, was unable to come up with information for the 1st CD.

The rest of the set that I've listened to sounds quite good, but this album is a bit disappointing.

Rather, the author tries to paint a picture that the Islamic regime has tried to have good relations with America, has often outsmarted\u00a0the west and it is America that has fumbled the opportunities to build good relations with Iran.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>As one last example, the author completely ignores the financial condition in Iran that gave the people a much higher living standard under the Shah than under the Islamic regime.\u00a0 In this context, although the author discusses uprisings during the Shah in part for financial inequity, the author categorically fails\u00a0to discuss the multiple uprisings during the Islamic regime and the brutal put down of those uprising by the regime.  Indeed, the author downplays the uprisings and the force used by the regime to put them down.\u00a0\u00a0<br \/><br \/>As such, even though this book provides a good overall history, it is very biased and should be read with that in mind.",

It was tremendously educational as the author wove the story around the downfall of the &#34;Soviet Union&#34; Jack Ryan is president and coping with a radical leader in Russia. Jack Ryan Jr is in London and his work leads him on a wild journey into Russia's underworld. If I had one criticism it would be that it was a little to wordy with regard to educating the reader on Russia's current goals of annexing their surrounding territories. Although, the Ukraine is in the news and struggling.  Linda Beaulieu",

  "text":"I hate this keyboard. When it decides to work correctly it's easy enough to type on, and the size and depth of the keys is nice. More often than not though, I find myself having to type more slowly than if I had just used the stupid on screen keyboard. If I type a word and then hit the space bar, it will give me several spaces instead of just one, which of course adds a period over the previous word and capitalizes the next one. Not so good when every word ends up becoming a new sentence. The delete key also does this, so I might be trying to delete just one of those extra spaces and also end up deleting half of the previous word. Occasionally the punctuation keys have this problem as well, though not as often, and none of the letters or numbers have ever done this. This seems to happen mostly when I first open an app and start typing, and goes away if I persevere and keep typing through the first couple of minutes. It doesn't seem to be related to any one specific app either.<br \/><br \/>I like the case itself. It is quite heavy, but for my purposes that doesn't really matter. I wouldn't want to carry it in a purse though. It's nice that the top comes off of the keyboard. The hinge doesn't work as well anymore though. I've had it less than a year, and it now will only hold its position if it's all the way open or about halfway closed. I also learned not to pick it up by the top (the part that actually holds the iPad) when it's open. The keyboard part will fall off, making a lot of noise and scaring anyone who happens to be in the same building.<br \/><br \/>It seems like I have a lot of complaints, but for the most part the case and keyboard work well enough for my occasional use. If I ever find a keyboard that works better I will definitely be replacing this one, but until then I will just view it as an exercise in patience.",

  "text":"The third collected volume of Brian Michael Bendis' New Avengers is nowhere near as good or enjoyable as the first two volumes.  In saying that, what we get here in Secrets & Lies isn't bad at all, it's just not as compelling as one would hope.  Secrets & Lies starts off in familiar territory with the New Avengers taking on Hydra who is trying to free the Silver Samurai, and leads up to Captain America recruiting a mysterious new member named Ronin.  As the TPB continues, Spider-Woman's secrets get revealed, as Cap learns the truth behind the return of her super powers, as well as just who she is working for.  The entire synopsis that you just read is actually more interesting than the actual events taking place here in Secrets & Lies, because Bendis just doesn't seem to be that into the story himself.  Ronin isn't that interesting of a character in my opinion, and the book focuses on too many single members (particularly Cap) than the group as a whole.  David Finch's artwork is his usual great stuff, as is the work by Frank Cho which is featured here as well.

I was able to &#34;take apart&#34; my wife's cane and make it work.  Her cane had an extra loop of elastic at the handle end (she uses it to hang her can or loop around her wrist), so I removed the cap on the handle, untied the knot and slipped it through the cap. I attached a long piece of sturdy wire to this end of the elastic and let it slide down the cane - this allowed the elastic to freely fall to the end of the cane where I looped the elastic that came with the roller tip onto the cane elastic - then hooked it onto the roller-tip.  pushed the roller tip into place - pulled the wire and elastic back through the handle end.  The challenging part was getting it back into the handle cap hole. I hade to use a screwdriver (or a ruler will work) to hold the second loop of elastic on top of the handle .  I pulled the elastic up through the handle and where the loop for the handle and the loop for the first section connected - I put the screwdriver through it and let it sit on tip of the handle (it will make a t-shape). I ended up using electrical tape to tape the top loop together so it was smaller and stiff to fit through the hole.  Once that was through - I pulled up on it until everything was tight - released the screwdriver - do not let go of that loop you put through the cap  - I then put a knot in place like it was before I disassembled. Replaced the cap and folded and unfolded the cane to ensure everything worked - had my wife try it to make sure the roller tip didn't flop off.  All checked out and the wife is happy! Success!",

It's small enough that it doesn't take up too much space on the counter but I am moving it into my den anyway.  It takes quite a bit of time to get a full basket of ice so if you plan on having ice for a party or cookout you might want to start a couple of hours beforehand.

Band is difficult to snap in. I don't like the band. Chances are high that it will fall off. Similar to the first Garmin Vivofit. After several complaints Garmin finally replaced snap on band with a lock. Something Fitbit should consider. So far it appears to be pretty much on target for step intake. I like the display screen. I'm looking forward to seeing how well Fitbit tracks my other activities. Quick update.  Been having issues syncing product. Customer Service told me that  can't sync to multiple products.  I have to pick only one device. Can't wear Apple Watch the same time I wear Fitbit. Other blue tooth devices interfere with Fitbit.  Customer service were quick to respond and cordial.  Overall the tracking is superior. If you can overlook the sync issues the Fitbit Alta is pretty consistent.",

Build quality is very good for rockpals, but the increased 20w claim over their previous models is just not true.  That said, I am still happy with the purchase, as I got this for right about $1\/w with a coupon code.  For that price, it's right in the ballpark for similar quality panels of the same type.  At the current, full retail price, your money would be better spent elsewhere.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE:<br \/>Shortly after posting my honest review, I was contacted by Wesley with rockpals who asked if I would remove my review for a 50% refund.  I told him no, that my review stands, and if they felt I got a bad panel then they could either refund me completely, or send a replacement.  They sent a replacement, and neither panel has ever produced more than 85w after a few weeks of summer sun.  My review is staying at 3 stars, but I almost feel it should be downgraded to 1 star after the attempt at bribing me to remove my rating.  These are just barely less than the high quality folding panels, but they absolutely do not perform as they should for the retail cost.  Even at $1\/watt, I doubt I would buy another or recommend anything rockpals due to this shady (and likely against TOS for Amazon) practice to make your product look better online.

Monish Behl is the rich son of a wealthy man. If you know your Bollywood you'll know exactly what sort of creep Behl will play here. Then there's Vivek Mushran, playing the dreamy middle-class kid.

  "text":"This is only the third book of Woodiwiss that I've read but it is definitely better than the others. She still does follow her formula of writing - characters have not much depth (we just know that they're astoundingly beautiful), the main female character is constantly sought out by every male alive everywhere .. anywhere and the main characters only seem to love each other for no reason other than their physical looks.<br \/><br \/>The story had a nice, interesting plot but it wasn't very difficult to figure out the whole book by the time the auction came around - Saxton, the night rider, what-not. Erienne was a likeable character although she was supposed to be a little strong-willed, but throughout the book she kept needing to be rescued by Christopher .. repeatedly. She seemed like a very weak person despite being called willfull but her 'willfullness' never existed.<br \/><br \/>Her treatment of Lord Saxton was awful I would have to say for someone who was supposed to be a compassionate person (she helped a man named Ben, who was also deformed I think, it was mentioned early in the book). I felt sorry for Lord Saxton and Christopher because there was obviously nothing redeemable in Erienne's character [but they don't love her because of her character, do they?]. Also hated how each and every man who ever crossed her path just absolutely cannot help himself & just wants to have her, it was just too unbelievable.<br \/><br \/>Christopher was an OK character, not much depth - could have delved deeper into that and also with Lord Saxton's character. Certain plot points weren't believable - why didn't Erienne's father let her marry Christopher .. isn't he just completely rich and that's all that matters to him? Why do the main characters love each other in the end? How could Erienne NOT know who she really married? [don't want to give anything away]. A decent enough read, the plot was interesting and unique although too thinly veiled. It was a little too long in my opinion, since the reader already knows by the first quarter what's going to happen and it takes a whole long, long time for it to draw out.<br \/><br \/>After reading this book, I'd have to say that this shall be my final Woodiwiss book. Her books are all too predictable and formulatic, they leave me with too many questions anyway. I know I'm probably the only one who dislikes her writing - this book has gotten such glowing reviews, but i just can't see it.",

  "text":"What I disliked the most after listening to this album was that I couldn't remember any catchy melody. Why?. It's been quite a long since the last time RAGE wrote a memorable song. I'm sorry, but their last albums don't have too many songs like that. It seems they are more focused in finding that RAGE trio vibe; their own sound with the Peavey-Terrana-Smolski line-up, than writing memorable songs. Maybe they don't want that. But they've donde better in the past, and that's what I ask after each new release.<br \/><br \/>RAGE sounds heavier than ever before. SPEAK OF THE DEAD is filled with classical solos and catchy choruses, fast, mid tempo and ballads; all the ingredients that a power metal album requires to be called so. However I do think there's something wrong here, or better said, is the lack of something...<br \/><br \/>And I'm not judging them as musicians. Because, this is the most talented line-up RAGE ever had. Terrana is one of the most solid drummers of the genre, Smolski is the perfect guitar for this kind of bands, with classical backgrounds. And Wagner has been there right from the start. You will notice they worked really hard. Each one of them adding their own touch of quality. Their skills as musicians are unquestionable.<br \/><br \/>SPEAK OF THE DEAD is polished and refined, heavy and classic. It might be the shadow of great albums like THE MISSING LINK clouding my jugdement here, but SOTD could have been much better. It's not terrible, just average...",

It started off abruptly and seldom let up.<br \/>I loved Liliana\u2019s character and quickly settled in to learn her story.  I found Meric much harder to like\/know.  I understand that\u2019s part of his character - he\u2019s severe, controlled, private.  But for most of the book I really struggled to like him, beyond how he cared for Liliana.  Seeing him through her eyes made him slightly more human, but I ended the book very conflicted over their relationship.  I think the fact that the story is primarily told from Liliana's perspective also added to the disparity in how well I felt I knew him.<br \/>Also, looking back, I was super engrossed as I was reading, but the story itself didn't actually have that much action. It was well dispersed, but somehow the author kept the suspense building to the end. Though I do have to admit, the ending seemed rather anticlimactic after everything that had been said and done.

  "text":"I bought this guitar because all of the good reviews. It does have a great sound and no need to cover what I liked about it because that's already been said by other reviewers.<br \/><br \/>However, here's what I didn't like about it:<br \/><br \/>1) It didn't come set up (adjusted)from the factory, or at least mine didn't, so make sure you buy it from a seller like Guitar Center who will do a proper setup for free. Most on-line sellers like Sweetwater will charge an extra $30 (+\/-) for a proper setup so you have to include that in the price to make a fair comparison with other guitars. My guitar had the action way too high and the high E was much lower to the frets than the low E (I realize that the bass strings vibrate more and require a little more spacing but not to the extent mine was)thus, the proper set up would have required about 1\/8\" shaved off of the saddle at a slight angle from high E to low E. Also, to be fair to Ibanez, the neck was adjusted properly, straight with just a slight dip in center, and the action at the nut was about right with minimal distance between the first fret and strings. However, the action should have been adjusted at the saddle and it most definitely was not making the guitar much more difficult to play and it was extremely disappointing that Ibanez didn't take time to check the action on the guitar before sending it out. Guitar center was willing to do a proper setup for free but here is why I elected not to let them do it and returned it instead;<br \/><br \/>2) A second and much more serious problem...The distance from the low E and high E to the edge of the neck was not proportional (equal). You can see where Ibanez attempted to correct the problem with two grooves on the saddle for the low E. But when you put the low E in the proper groove which made the low and high E proportional to the neck edge, the low E was too close to the A string and not in line with the string pin. Hence, the neck, or the bridge, or the saddle within the bridge, was obviously mounted improperly and Guitar Center agreed and gave me a full refund. Also, the low E string pin hole was drilled too small and the pin would not seat properly (it was much higher than the other pins).<br \/><br \/>Summary: While I expect less expensive materials in a $150 guitar, I still expected quality in workmanship to be maintained which this guitar obviously lacked. So the fact, Ibanez was too cheap to set the guitar up properly in the factory and had obvious quality issues was enough to make me return it. Also, this is a 7\/8 size parlor guitar which I knew up front but was willing to try it anyway for my seven year old. Be forewarned if you are buying this for a child under 10 years of age, it is a little too large unless your child is unusually large for their age. You probably should stick with a 3\/4 size guitar for kids under 10.<br \/><br \/>After much research and talking to guitar teachers who teach children, I have ordered the Yamaha APXT2 3\/4 size guitar which has rave reviews. While it won't sound as good as this acoustic, for $50 more ($199) I get a built in tuner and pickup and a much more stylish cut away guitar. Also, reviewers say when the Yamaha is plugged in, it sounds as good as most acoustic\/electrics priced $300-$1000. So if you're willing to compromise the pure acoustic sound of the PN15 for a guitar with a little less fullness\/rich sound in acoustic mode but in electric mode it sounds killer, I would say spend the extra $50 for the Yamaha. However, if you're an enthusiast and don't mind tweaking the PN15 and having it setup properly, then you may want to take a chance on this guitar but be sure and check it out thoroughly to make sure ther are no quality control issues as there was with mine.<br \/><br \/>Cheers!",

Although they do look great, they can tend to slip shortly after application, leading to the buttons sticking down during gameplay. After minor adjustments, they allow the buttons to function properly. Toward the end of the time I owned the appliques, I just removed the parts that go around the buttons. After I grew tired of the slipping, I removed them. Now this is where my review of the appliques gets a little more negative. The residue left behind on my controller had me using general purpose cleaner and a needle to remove the gunk left behind on the surface and seams.

  "text":"Invicta is a brand that had a good reputation but has exploded with oversized, blingy offerings full of bells and whistles. This particular model is very attractive -- not overly flashy (although the gold tone is somewhat unusual, with a slighty peachier cast than pictured) and well proportioned. The Roman numerals are subtle and easy to read. This isn't the case with the small inner dials that give the day, date and 24 hour clock; they are quite small, which makes them more difficult to read, although the small size compliments the look of the face better, in my opinion. The whole effect is dressy, but classy. That's the good news. The dials to change the time and date, etc. are extremely difficult to use. It's lucky I have strong fingernails; I was afraid I was going to break one, or the watch, trying to set it. It has a quite thick case, which is usual for inexpensive watches. On my slender wrist, it would be far too thick and heavy. I don't even think I could remove enough links to make this watch fit my wrist. It's sized for a man, or a very large or overweight woman. The watch works well now, but when I looked up Invicta with consumeraffairs.com I was shocked at how many extremely negative complaints there were. Many people report their watches failing after a short period of time, and lament terrible customer service. Some of the scenarios include the hands coming loose, stem falling out -- indicating extremely poor quality design and quality control. Although I initially was going to rate this watch 4 stars, after doing some investigating, I couldn't in good conscience. Invicta routinely sells watches for $70-100 that were &#34;originally&#34; nearly ten times that price. It's ludicrous. They may have some good watches at a higher price point, but this is not a $600 watch being sold for an insanely good price by the boatload. No company could do that. $90 is still a lot of money. My advice would be to invest a little bit more on a watch that is actually going to last and is actually on sale (a reasonable discount), not marked down from $600 to $91. On the other hand, you might be lucky and get one that came out of the Chinese factory in tip top shape. Just don't expect to get much help from Invicta customer service once the 30 day amazon.com return period ends.",

  "text":"As much as I like Bernstein in Mahler and Beethoven, I really dislike his way with Sibelius.<br \/><br \/>That's an opinion that I formed early on in my journey with classical music, back in the days of the LP, in fact. Now that I think about it, I probably have not heard these recordings since they made their first appearance on CD. But being one who is always open to reevaluating my position on music and\/or musicians, this newly remastered version of Bernstein's Sibelius cycle provided an opportunity to look anew at one of my favorite composers seen through the eyes of one of my favorite conductors.<br \/><br \/>Alas, I'm left with my existing feelings well intact - Bernstein just doesn't &#34;get it&#34; when it comes to the Sibelian ethos. His Sibelius is hyperactive, goosed and boosted beyond the point of excitement into the realm of the ridiculous. Such an approach - which, truth be told, is fairly one-dimensional - tends to make the music sound much less interesting and less deep than it actually is. Sure, there are those always interesting &#34;Lenny&#34; moments where the conductor elevates a secondary or tertiary voice to &#34;I hadn't noticed that before&#34; prominence, but doing so doesn't add anything to one's appreciation or understanding of the music, especially when a byproduct is that the true leading voice gets buried. Elevating Sibelius' ostinato motor rhythms to prominence makes as much sense as would elevating an Alberti bass to prominence in a classical sonata.<br \/><br \/>The First and Second Symphonies suffer the most from this approach, with both pieces coming off as strangely inconsequential compositions (his DG remakes are far, far superior). The Third rather hangs fire most of the time, with the closing bars ending in a most-perfunctory manner. The Fourth is so far off course from the norm that one might be taken in by the prospect, but the almost-always forte dynamic approach causes the various choirs of the orchestra to play at a heightened dynamic level for their parts to cut through the din, and this results in a tonal quality that misses the composer's intent. There is no mystery here, no sense of anything lying beneath the notes themselves.<br \/><br \/>The Fifth fares a little better (as does Pohoja's Daughter), but it is let down by a bland final movement, with the final disconnected chords despatched in the tritest of manners. The Sixth is an uncommitted affair that comes off as a read through, rather than a performance, with a finale that is a not-always-successful scramble for notes and ensemble at a speed that's too fast by half. The Seventh starts out promisingly enough, but Bernstein then elects to goose up the tempi and the dynamics to the extent that this 4-movement-symphony-in-1-movement loses all sense of being a unique direction for the composer. Somehow, Bernstein makes it sound...common.<br \/><br \/>The performance of the Violin Concerto is another overheated, square, monochromatic and ultimately off-putting affair. I invite you to compare this version to the Ferras\/Karajan version on DG to hear what is missing in Bernstein's approach. It's night and day. We get something of a bonus in the way of Bruch #1 being coupled on this CD (conducted by Thomas Schippers) - not the greatest performance, but a superior performance to its Sibelius disc mate.<br \/><br \/>The final CD in the set is a &#34;Great Performances&#34; disc of Grieg Peer Gynt Suites 1 & 2 and Sibelius' Finlandia, The Swan of Tuonela and Valse triste. Again, it's hard to feel that Bernstein has any real affinity for these pieces. He just doesn't trust them to work on their own merits and seems to feel compelled to pick and pull them into something that he can relate to. Compare his Grieg to Beecham or Karajan and you'll see what I mean.<br \/><br \/>For the sake of completeness, I'd mention that the set also includes Luonnotar (coupled with the 1st Symphony), featuring soprano Phyllis Curtin. Having had master classes with Ms Curtin back in 1974-75, I don't want to be too harsh with her, but her performance misses the other-wordly quality evoked by other sopranos like Karita Mattila and Soile Isokoski, whose voices have an easier top range and who can at least disguise the effort necessary to sing this piece.<br \/><br \/>I can't express how disappointed I was with this set, due entirely to Bernstein's interpretation (the re-done sound is excellent, while the playing of the NYPO is top notch, save for a few blemishes here and there). Compared to Sibelius masters like Herbert von Karajan and Lorin Maazel (try his Pittsburgh set, also on Sony at about HALF the price of this one) who find layer after layer of interest and nuance in this music, Bernstein hardly qualifies as the Sibelian country cousin. Sibelius' music operates on many levels, and it's very odd that a musician of Bernstein's stature seems to be blind and deaf to most of those levels. This is Sibelius taken not on the composer's terms, but on those of the conductor.<br \/><br \/>As there are many great Sibelius options out there these days at every conceivable price point, I find myself unable to recommend this version on any level. Indeed, I would even recommend Sir Colin Davis' just-reissued RCA cycle above this - it features sound and interpretations that are superior to the set under review, along with some glaring lapses of ensemble - even though I found myself calling that set uncompetitive in an amazon review I penned just a few months ago.<br \/><br \/>I wish I could be more enthusiastic, but I can't.<br \/><br \/>Two and a half stars - it's okay...barely.",

It has 2 thin straps inside for closing the robe and then 2 thicker straps of uneven lengths on the outside for holding it closed, and all 4 are permanently attached. I'm honestly not sure how these 4 straps work together. If using the inside 2 you would still need to use the outside 2 or you would be tripping over the long one, and the 2 inside don't actually hold the entire robe closed. Anyways, the robe is just not comfortable with the 4 straps, and the fixed length outer straps, not being of equal length and sewn into the robe just makes this product a poor design.<br \/><br \/>Sadly I might not buy another robe through Amazon, preferring the in person inspection that a brick-and-mortar store allows.

  "text":"Success really is a double edged sword. Twisted Sister was putting out some great music on albums like \"Under the Blade\", and then when \"Stay Hungry\" hit it so big with \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" and \"I Wanna Rock\" the band found themselves in the world of music's Top 10. They tried to capitalize on their success with \"Come Out And Play\", an album that was made for FM airplay, lots of pop-metal including a remake of Leader of the Pack. Unfortunately for Twisted Sister, the videos and antics seemed too cartoonish for most of the base demo, the metalheads. So after \"Come Out and Play\" fizzled they hit the studio and came out with \"Love is for Suckers\", which takes the band to new heights of pop-metal. The songs are pretty good, and the entire album is a paint-by-numbers hair-metal cd, but...it's not really a Twisted Sister album. The opening track \"Wake up the Sleeping Giant\" and the closed track \"Yeah Right\" are the only two tracks that differentiate themselves and sound like original Twisted Sister tracks, the rest of the album is a good KISS album, and I swear it's almost like Dee Snyder channeled Gene Simmons vocals on some of these tunes. But the album is worth picking up for \"Sleeping Giant\" alone. It's almost uncanny how the song parallels the feelings most Americans are dealing with after Sept. 11, 2001. This song was written years before the attacks, yet could still be the anthem for American sentiment in the time that has followed. It's a shame Twisted Sister packed it in after this album, but I guess with the death of the hair metal scene there wasn't much left for them to do.",

But it gets entirely too much credit, because its not anything very wonderful or deep.<br \/>Ill start with the good.  This is great party music.  Lots of happy, fast, danceable beats mix well with Ludas cartoonish style of rap.  When hearing songs like Move or Go 2 Sleep, you cant help but get into the music.  ....  This is nothing new, but Luda gives it a twist by adding his wit.  Keep it on the Hush and Crybaby are good examples of his crazy humor.  Luda is a pretty good rapper, and consistently brings good rhyme schemes, crazy\/happy beats, and jokes through the whole CD.<br \/>But thats it.  The beats are good party beats, but theyre very forgettable.  The lyrics barely ever change, and on the couple of tracks where they do it doesnt work very well.  Cold Outside doesnt sound very good after hearing songs like Saturday, and there are much better \"ghetto life\" songs.  Luda cant do much beyond his crazy humor.  Skill-wise, there are  plenty of rappers out there who can beat him.  ....  Thats why I call it cartoon rap.  Cartoons are entertaining and fun, but usually kind of dumb, and there is no deeper meaning.  Just cheap laughs.

It's possible that I was a bit distracted by it being the first book I've read on the Kindle, but I don't think that was the only reason.  My favorite part of Mr. King's writing has always been his characterizations.  You could always identify with at least one character; remember feeling\/thinking the same things they were; really recognize them.  I didn't get this in Under the Dome.  All the characters felt stereotypical -- really bad bad-guy, really good good-guy -- with some \"extras\" thrown in to fill out the story.<br \/><br \/>The story itself started a little slow, but got more interesting as it went along.

The lens caps do not have a security tie, one is loose and the other is attached to the rim of the monocular end, so you really have to press it away from the lens view to see unobstructed. You can remove the little strap on the middle of the bottom and mount it onto any 1\/4 tripod mount, so that makes it a little more versatile.<br \/><br \/>This isn't 80x100 magnification, I find it to be about half of that at best.

There are some pros and cons that will vary from user to user. There is room for some simple improvements. The odor is very strong out of the package.

Winnie sees him remove neatly stacked stones to reveal a water spring.  After taking a drink, he replaces the stones.  It\u2019s at this point that he notices Winnie.

Noticing that Winnie knows the secret of the water, she quickly decides that they must spirit Winnie away until they can tell her about their secret and ensure that she will keep it.

His other books - including under his pseudonym Noah Bly - have also been enjoyable. Unfortunately, White Creek doesn't live up to those. I think the main culprit is the lack of character development: the book takes place over two days, so there's not much time for growth. The book seems to push more of a \"what the heck is going on\" narrative, rather than a \"why\"?

  "text":"As other reviewers already mentioned, there's little about this book that is specific to Linux, besides brief mentions about system calls and how the Linux kernel manages memory using paging and doesn't use segmentation (although it did in earlier versions). The syntax used is also that of NASM, which is similar to MASM (Microsoft Assembler) and thus very different from the AT&T syntax used by the GNU tools such as GAS (the GNU Assembler). So don't get it expecting to see a lot of consideration about specific quirks to assembly programming under Linux.<br \/><br \/>But this would not fit into the book, anyway. It is clearly geared towards beginners: the material is quite basic and superficial, and assumes no previous knowledge of assembly, only a basic C programming background. The second chapter begins by describing the typical fetch-execute cycle of a CPU; this is very superficial and does not take account of pipelining, superscalar execution and other effects present in current processors. But it does give an idea about how the hardware works. Then there are chapters about arithmetic in different bases and binary signed arithmetic, a basic introduction to assembly, machine language, dealing with memory, the stack, and interrupts. Then there is a strange chapter in a book about Linux assembly language programming: DOS programs. It seems that the book was being prepared for DOS but then it became obsolete and the material was reworked to cater to Linux programmers.<br \/><br \/>Nevertheless, though quite basic and not enough about Linux, it can serve as a quick introduction to assembly programming for beginners. The organization could be better too, but I don't think it's that confusing. A beginner would have to look for other books after this, though, and an experienced programmer would be better off skipping it altogether.",

It just buzzes because I got a text, and then a minute later the text shows up but I can't click it. The screen won't rotate, I can't do anything. It will only turn off and back on.

It is pretty much the same quality as what you would find at an army surplus store or those Asian trinket stores in you local mall.<br \/><br \/>Obviously at this price,it is not full tang and could get dangerous if you tried to really cut with it. It's one of those screw welded to the blade, running through the tsuka jobs - the screw is then fastened with a nut under the pommel which is hot glued on. While it serves it's purpose, this setup is more prone to breakage if you get too aggressive with the sword.<br \/><br \/>The tsuka itself is just a shaped piece of wood covered in a low quality ito (pretty much a shoe lace.) No same of any kind, not even plastic. The saya is flat black, and has the imprint of a crest similar to that of Oda in red paint. I was actually pretty surprised about the fit of some of the parts. Generally swords I've had of this quality\/price-point had loose koiguchi that would cause the blade to fall out of the saya if held upside down - this surprisingly was pretty tight fitting.<br \/><br \/>Overall I would tend to agree that this sword is best suited for decoration or cosplay, its dull enough that you wont really get hurt or hurt anyone if you're swinging it around.

The static graphics (namely, the backgrounds) are very beautiful. The 3-D character modeling is... well... let's just say it could use work. The ending was pretty disappointing too.

I did all that to just see a nice shot of CGI snowflakes??\"<br \/>And the puzzles. Oh boy, the puzzles. This is the point on which I mainly urge Myst fans to consider waiting to buy Syberia at the [$$]-Bargain Shelf.<br \/>The puzzles were simplistic, repetitive, and absolutely non-thought provoking. Some puzzles were challenging, but only because they required lots of walking-clicking or maybe you just weren't looking at your screen hard enough (i.e. the mammoth drawing).<br \/>Myst fans, expect to finish this game in a few hours. I was very disappointed, but I was able to console myself with the fact that I hadn't bought the game when it first came out (and cost [more$$]).<br \/>I do not recommend Syberia for Myst fans who are looking for something in league with the Myst series.<br \/>However, if you aren't a Myst fan, then I say this is the perfect game for you.

I'm glad I have the second pair which I will use until it dies and I can justify buying a new one.<br \/><br \/>They are tinted, which is cool if you swim in bright sunlight. I do not. I am a crazy person who wakes up before dawn to go swim, so it is still dark. They don't really hinder my vision though, and on the rare days that the sun comes up before I'm done, they do come in handy. They are also mirrored, so people stare at you because they think you can't see them. But on the other hand, you can stare back and they won't know. Introverts unite.<br \/><br \/>The anti-fog doesn't work very well. After 4-5 laps, I will have to wipe the inside lens. Same goes with leakage. After a few laps, I do have to sort of empty the goggles, but since I swim freestyle face down, it doesn't bother me very much. It fits very well and doesn't leave too bad of an imprint. I like that it came with different sizes for the nose bridges, though I never actually tried changing it. Maybe I will now with my broken pair. They also give you some free ear plugs but I'm paranoid about using those. Because what if it gets stuck inside and then I have to walk around with plastic ear plugs in my ear all the time???<br \/><br \/>Overall, an okay purchase if you're just starting out, but I'm going to go with a sturdier pair next time.",

I also wasn't happy to get to 85% on my kindle only to have the rest of it be nothing but excerpts from 6 different books by other authors. the storyline was great, I just feel that there could've been so much more to this story.

  "text":"It's a fun game targeted at the younger crowd.  You create a portion of a zoo and gradually populate it with two adults, breed two offspring in the nursery, and then upgrade their habitat once or twice until completed.  The habitat earns increasing amounts of game coins throughout this process.  The animals can be purchased with coins (generated by the game) or gems (purchased by your hard cold cash through Amazon).  You can also breed animals from the past (mammoth from an elephant and a bear) or fiction (unicorn).  Like other Team Lava games, there is a strong social aspect to the game--you need neighbors to send you items to buy additional space or to build certain habitats.  There is value in playing nice.  You need to collect the game coins from the \"zoo\" throughout the day--or once a day.<br \/><br \/>I've enjoyed the game but I think it is less for adults and more for children.  I haven't found too many ways to earn gems to buy some of the animals so that is a major disappointment.  But children do like viewing the zoo habitats and clicking on them for the lion's roar or the elephant's trumpeting.<br \/><br \/>It has strong value as a shared game experience with adult(s) and child\/children.

Carpet ruined and will need to be replaced. Nice file cabinet, if you get one without the blob.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: Was able to get grease spot out of carpet with special chemicals, so no longer need to replace carpet. Quite the relief. Updated review to 3 stars. Would have given 4 start but-not-for the grease situation, as file cabinet itself is fine for it's price point.",

  "text":"In Juan Gomez-Jurado's \"The Moses Expedition, what begins as a compelling mystery regarding a Nazi, a Jewish orphan and a priceless map hidden within a gold heirloom candle quickly becomes a mediocre adventure tale that attempts to rival the archaeological suspense of [[ASIN:B002J8JIEK Indiana Jones Trilogy: Raiders of the Lost Ark; Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom & Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (SET OF 3 VHS)]] while injecting the action with 21st century threats and conspiracies by Jihadist terrorists, Vatican secret service, a reclusive billionaire, CIA operatives, inquiring reporters and military fanatics.<br \/><br \/>Gomez-Jurado peppers his main plotline--the expedition to uncover the Biblical Ark of the Covenant--with the fascinating albeit sentimental background tale of billionaire Raymond Kayn--the man with the money funding the trip.  While this portion of the story works well, unfortunately the interplay between recurring characters ([[ASIN:B0040RMFNE God's Spy]]) Father Anthony Fowler and down-on-her-luck reporter Andrea Otero somehow doesn't.  Neither character gets to show any detailed facet of personality--Fowler as the dark horse Vatican agent masterfully succeeds at whatever he sets out to do while Otero manages only to grate on the reader's nerves with her two-dimensional need to lick her romantic wounds and get her story ersatz-Hildy Johnson-style([[ASIN:B00006RCLG His Girl Friday]]).  Both these characters could be worthy of further episodic offerings where their true nature is brought slowly to light.  It would benefit Gomez-Juarado to limit their flippant interplay (think Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood) that somehow loses something in the Spanish to English translation. Instead of the campy stereotypes utilized in Spielberg's masterpieces, the character of Fowler should be taken seriously and if he is to be viewed with gravitas Gomez-Jurado must spend more time cultivating flashbacks and memories that will intrigue, present a piece of the puzzle one bit at a time and thereby forcing his reader to suspend disbelief at the cliffhanger and clamor for more and more. Gomez-Jurado paints the present Fowler in tones of the sinister fantastic; is he meant to be Ortero's foil or just a man with such a dark past that he could have Jason Bourne signing up for an advanced course in the art of espionage? Unforgivably, as it now stands, Fowler comes off as a little more than a tight-lipped Rambo and Otero as the loquacious sidekick damsel that Rambo typically wants to belt in the mouth.  Rx? More development, please!<br \/><br \/>In this same vein, the actual expedition portion of the novel becomes a tragedy of errors.  Everything goes wrong from start to finish, but not in the humorous style for which Spielberg is famous: think Indy trudging to freedom reluctantly through a pit of snakes when he has fumed long and loud about his ophidiophobia to anyone that would listen.  A bit of farce in the desert would supplement the nerve frazzle of brutal circumstances and the egotistical head butting of too many characters with individual agendas with some necessary laughter--perhaps not on the part of the players but from the perspective of the reader. Sadly, Gomez-Jurado decides to play it straight sticking to the time-honored formula of weaving the incidents and the points of view of heroes and villains in short alternating chapters that keep the flow of the story moving steadily towards its so-so conclusion. Rx? More humor or more thrilling intrigue, please!<br \/><br \/>Bottom Line? Author Gomez-Jurado definitely has the style and descriptive ability to create a well-constructed novel with memorable characters.  In \"The Moses Expedition\" he just takes himself too seriously as he relates a tale involving his recurring character, covert-op priest Anthony Fowler, in a thriller archaeological expedition to uncover the Ark of the Covenant.  If Gomez-Jurado uses the style made famous by other popular writers of suspense (Dan Brown, David Baldacci, Steve Berry, Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child), he must come up with a much more intricate plot where history\/the Bible\/conspiracies all come together to titillate the reader and make him\/her thirst for the next Fowler offering.  \"The Moses Expedition features all the prerequisite fanatics, but none of the puzzles or facts. Recommend only to those who want more of Anthony Fowler.<br \/>Diana Faillace Von Behren<br \/>\"reneofc\"",

  "text":"With the gorgeous setting of 18th Venice during the mysterious season of  Carnevale, the story features a secret society, murder, suspense, and a love story.  Elizabeth McKenna's latest novel, Venice in the Moonlight, was an enjoyable short read (it's only 186 pages).  But perhaps it was too short...the conflicts were well developed but were resolved too quickly, in my opinion.  There wasn't much depth to the resolutions , which left me wanting for more explanation.<br \/>The story follows young Marietta - a widow at the age of 20 - who spent 5 years of her young life married to a horrible husband and an even worse mother-in-law.  After her husband's sudden death, she was banished from the family home in Verona and sent back to her hometown of Venice.  She hoped to make amends with her widowed father who had married her off to this horrid family, only to find out that her father had died a few months earlier.  Marietta had been angry at her father for 5 years, trying to figure out why he had chosen to marry her into the horrible Gatti family.  But, as she finds out more and more about her father's life during those 5 estranged years, she comes to realize that he only did what he felt was best for her and that he still loved her so much.  As she delves into the circumstances leading up to her father's &#34;accidental&#34; death, she discovers that someone had been out to get him.  But why?  Her sleuthing into Venice's dark corners puts her in danger herself.  Someone doesn't want her to uncover some dark secrets and Marietta finds herself alone, not knowing whom she can trust.<br \/>Enter the love story (which, by the way, I ended up enjoying the most out of the story).  During her &#34;exile&#34; from Verona, she had been rescued by the handsome Nico when her carriage had gotten stuck in mud.  After arriving in Venice, she kept running into this handsome man.  At first, she didn't trust him - he seemed to be a womanizer and a cad -just like her late husband had been.  She didn't want to give her heart to someone just to have him use her and then discard her when he tired of her.  So she played it safe and pursued a strictly business relationship with him, trying to use his influence to discover more about her father's death.  Time passed, and things changed...<br \/>All in all, the book was entertaining and I would recommend it for a quick read.  The setting was great and the author described 18th century Venice beautifully - down to the masks worn during the Carnevale season.  I just wish that the conflict resolutions weren't dismissed so easily.  It seemed that the grave dangers the characters found themselves in, and which had been building up throughout the story, were resolved within moments.",

  "text":"espite their reputation as a premier live act, Led Zeppelin shined as a studio band; Page was a perfectionist genius as a producer, and it shows in the sound quality and performance on pretty much all of their studio work.  But live, they were hit-or-miss.  It often took Robert Plant three or four songs to warm up enough to hit the higher registers for which he was most famous, and Page's playing often ranged from immaculate to sloppy within a single show -- even a single song.  (The Jones\/Bonham rhythm section, however, was always consistently tight and superior.)  Generally, Zeppelin did better live shows in its early days, up until 1973 tours supporting Houses of the Holy.  After that, Page's live playing, started to audibly deteriorate.  On this disc, Page's tone, technique, and taste are at low ebb, unfortunately, and performances are pretty much Jones's and Bonham's to save.  If you are going to buy live Zeppelin, stick to &#34;How the West Was Won&#34; or even &#34;The Song Remains the Same&#34;, or bootlegs from their first and second album era.

I waited to get a DC amp meter to measure the current before I finally replaced the fuse again. My theory is that the breaker burned the short out that was in the headlight switch. The headlight switch no longer works in the headlight position, but still works in the running position, and the only way to get high beam is in the flash position. I previously had the same problem with the switch that I had replaced, but at the time, I didn't know that the switch had burned out as a result of a short.

I love a monthly surprise to treat myself as I have 3 kids ( 4 if you include my husband ) but I am sorry I won't spend forty dollars on this again. Very disappointed \ud83d\ude14",

What I'm saying is that you're paying too much for getting too little products or really products that you actually don't need. They should include more nibs especially. Literally, you can buy an oblique pen that comes with multiple nibs and buy a bottled inked for much greater price. The graph paper and the vellum paper is not necessary at all and it's small too.

The 1 extra mm over the standard 16 mm that others have may not seem like much, but it could make all the difference.

IT is plenty thick enough to prevent the tube from squeezing through the holes, and it allows you to have that extra mm width without worrying that you won't be able to seat your tire. This would be a 5 star review if not for the fact that either Zefal or the sellers decided to sell me REMNANTS disguised as full priced, new, uncut rolls. My first roll was fine. The second had two lengths of tape. The start of the roll reached about 2\/3 around the wheel, and then another length was badly stitched to the first. So badly stitched that when I stretched it to make the two ends reach, they already pulled apart held on barely buy just two stitched. But the actual tape ends were almost a half in apart. Right over a spoke hole. There is no way it would have provided any protection. Even if it was stitched better and didn't come apart, and WASN'T right over a spoke hole, this would still be unacceptable to sell as a new roll of tape. I am now unable to ride my bike all weekend until I get a replacement because when I took the old tape off, it never occurred to me to do it carefully to save it just in case I was fraudulently sold useless pieces of tape that offered no protection.",

It stars Kieffer Sutherland as David, Corey Haim as Sam, Jason Patric as Michael, Jami Gertz as Star, Corey Feldman as Edgar, Dianne Wiest as the mother.<br \/><br \/>Story:  Two teenage brothers Michael and Sam with their mother who has divorced,  move to a small town in Northern California.  Sam is befriended by two comic-book nerds who warn him about vampires living in the town.  Michael meets and falls for a pretty girl named Star, who seems to like David, the leader of a gang of vampires.  Sam and his new friends must save Michael and Star from becoming full vampires.<br \/><br \/>This is one of the better, if not the best teen vampire movies to come out of the 1980\u2019s.  It has a very good soundtrack and is surprisingly entertaining with some real scarry moments. This said, it is obviously meant for the issues facing the adolescent. It explores the teenager\u2019s need to find themselves and where they fit in society.  In the process, they grow up and learn to deal maturely with serious issues of life including drugs, all shrouded in a humorous campy manner.  Definitely easy viewing.  I give this film 3 stars.",

  "text":"Assassin's Creed definitely has a following, and there was a fair enough bit of excitement when Revelations was released.  I played Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed II, but never bothered with AC Brotherhood.  I mostly enjoy playing single player campaigns and don't often get into the online gaming component.  I was playing Uncharted 3: Drake's Fortune, a superior game, when I received AC Revelations, but was excited about playing a game in 3D.<br \/><br \/>Assassin's Creed Revelations is the fourth game in the series, and the first to be introduced in 3D.  Along with the disc which includes the original Assassin's Creed, Revelations, and Uplay Passport access, is a pair of stiff paper Trioviz 3D glasses manufactured by American Paper Optics, LLC and the Uplay Passport Code.<br \/><br \/>* Graphics<br \/>The graphics are nothing spectacular and reminiscent of previous games.  Supporting characters and street people are stiff, and fabric doesn't flow.  With the exception of landmarks, distinct wealthy and poor neighborhood buildings are constructed of reused facades with very little variance from one block to the next.  Plus, artifacting can occasionally be seen when opening treasure chests.  3D play, using the old style red\/green lens glasses, feels more gimmicky than it adds to the game, plus tends to give me a headache after about 20 minutes.<br \/><br \/>* Single Player Campaign<br \/>Desmond is in a coma, and to save himself he must finish the Ezio Auditore da Firenze memories to separate him mind from the animus.  Along the way, Desmond will also access Altair ibn La-Ahad memories, and have access to animus puzzle mazes.  While there is a story, the game largely progresses through a checklist of tasks and memories to complete.  Tasks include opening businesses to make money, collecting weapons and books, locating animus fragments, Ishak Pasha's memoir pages, and treasure chests, restore and open guilds, save citizens then train them to be assassins, send assassins on missions, build bombs, find five keys, and play the memories\/missions.  Completing all these tasks just feels like busy work serving to distract from a thin storyline.<br \/><br \/>Then there are bugs to deal with.  Since the camera view is behind Ezio, there are occasions during fight scenes where the view of action is replaced by a wall or tree so you can't effectively fight or defend yourself.  While other times Ezio may mysteriously fall through stone steps only to pop out again moments later.  Plus, trophies like Sage don't trigger when collecting all the books has been achieved, forcing people to replay the game in order to acquire this achievement.<br \/><br \/>Fortunately there are fun moments to the game, such as performing an aerial assassination, disarming an enemy to kill them with their own weapon, or grabbing an enemy to shove them into collapsing scaffolding which crushes them.  Plus the hook blade is a fun new weapon and utility tool.  Sometimes it can be more fun to search out guards to attack, than to play the DNA memories.<br \/><br \/>* Online Content<br \/>Online multiplayer gaming starts off with a cinematic, a profile building process then off to the animus introductory sessions which are basic tutorials.  The first online game, a death match, is basically made of two teams where contract hits are set out against opposing teams.  Other gaming options include death matches, wanted, assassinate, steal the artifact, corruption, manhunt, chest capture, artifact assault, and escort.  I couldn't figure out how to get to these other options and got bored with the deathwatch in which I do poorly in anyway.  I do far better in online games where I am part of a support structured team like Battlefield Bad Company.<br \/><br \/>The worst feature of this game is the single use passport code for online game play, an effective method of devaluing used game sales.  Once a person tries the online gaming, the next person has to purchase a new passport code to utilize the online gaming component.  So a new game is purchased whole, and a used game is sold with access to only half the content.  It's not like the original owner can continue to play online either, only Ubisoft benefits from this greed inspired tactic.  Unfortunately, this is a tactic many gaming studios are going towards.<br \/><br \/>If you are looking for a game to occupy your time, Assassin's Creed Revelations is worth looking at.  However, those looking for a story line based action adventure will probably be disappointed by the strong focus on task lists.  Additionally resale capabilities are reduced due to Ubisoft's greed inspired online play code requirements.  While this game can be fun to play, there are stronger game titles to consider.<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>Fun fighting\/attack skills<br \/>Long lasting game for those who want to complete every option<br \/>Includes the original Assassin's Creed for additional playable content<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>Game feels like a list of chores<br \/>Online content required code activation<br \/>Glitchy game play and trophies<br \/>3D gives me a headache",

However the writing style is very mixed - there are soaring paragraphs that leave you breathless with wonder, and there is also a lot of convoluted writing, including massive digressions, which, while giving expression to the author's tremendous depth of knowledge, also leave you wondering where on earth you are. Many times I had to go back and reread to find where I was after such digressions.

Those are comfortable, but kept sagging down low. One pair also began to lose the elastic at the waist almost immediately. Wanting something I wouldn't have to worry about sagging, I ordered my regular size a few weeks later. Those are a little tight, even after losing 10lb this summer.

  "text":"\"Green Left Weekly\", published by the Democratic Socialist Party, bills itself as \"Australia's radical newspaper\" and an alternative to the corporate-controlled media.<br \/><br \/>I have read \"Green Left Weekly\" both in print and online for over a decade now, though my relatives always try to dissuade me because they feel it angers me. The newspaper is indeed extremely preachy and uncompromising, never allowing the rulers they despise any compromise. The language is often terribly ranty and exaggerated, focusing consistently on the profit system that the paper believes responsible for social and ecological problems. It is also very repetitive because the focus and topics covered are so similar in every issue. It would really be a lot better if the radical left learnt that low-frequency periodicals are the best medium for carrying their messages, because they become less repetitive and preachy without losing the radically uncompromising nature of their message.<br \/><br \/>Whilst this perspective makes \"Green Left Weekly\" difficult as regular reading, the paper nonetheless possesses a good deal of useful information, especially about Australia's appalling environmental record, which it has (rightly) attacked ever since being first published. These messages do not fit in with the popular perspective in an extremely socially conservative country - especially of its working classes whom \"Green Left Weekly\" claim to represent - but scientifically there is no doubt of their truth.<br \/><br \/>\"Green Left Weekly\" also has political problems. Whilst its claims about Cuba's excellent environmental record may be true, claims that Cuba is a democracy are very dubious and are most likely related to the newspaper's tendency to blame the US and its rulers for almost every problem. The paper does not explain why many refugees leave Cuba, nor that Cuba has a powerful secret police (the G2) whose archives have never been touched by outsiders.<br \/><br \/>Nonetheless, \"Green Left Weekly\" is worth a read for the information it provides that no-one in Australia or abroad tends to hear. Would undoubtedly be better as a monthly or quarterly periodical that was less repetitive, though - not to mention its readers' inability to achieve desperately-needed communication with the mass of Australians.",

  "text":"Close-up:  A woman's leg, tan but stubbly.  Slowly, a hand enters the frame, holding a Philips HP6576\/60 Satin Perfect Epilator (white\/purple),  The hand's thumb clicks the \"on\" button and the epilator begins to buzz loudly.  The hand cautiously lowers the epilator to the leg and begins to run it up the shin.  A voice is heard:<br \/><br \/>\"Ow, that really hurts!  Son of a [bleep]!\" But the hand continues to run the epilator on the leg until, a minute later, it shuts off the epilator. The camera pans the leg, showing that it is now mostly smooth, with some fine hairs still present.  The voice is heard again: \"No [bleep]ing way I'm doing this. It hurts like a son of a [bleep]!\"<br \/><br \/>Fadeout.<br \/><br \/>The leg, hand and voice were mine.  The dialog is real, recorded by my husband without my knowledge.<br \/><br \/>I remembered the old-time epilators.  Really scary devices that could rip your skin to shreds in addition to yanking out your hair.  I heard they are much better now, so I thought I'd give it a try.  This epilator charged very quickly, and I was ready to do the deed in well under an hour.<br \/><br \/>I don't think there's any way this thing could cut into your skin.  It does what it's supposed to do: pull out your hair by its roots.  It doesn't get everything, though.  I have fine hair on my legs and this didn't pick up about a tenth of the hair.  Not to mention it's loud and it hurts!  I have cavities filled without novocaine, but I'm not ready to make an epilator part of my routine.  For anybody who waxes, this will probably be no big deal, in which case I say go for it.  For myself, I'll just shave, thanks.<br \/><br \/>My three-star rating is due to the epilator's noisiness and the fact that it removed most but not all the hair in its path, leaving about one-tenth of my hair unplucked even after multiple passes.  I didn't downgrade it due to the pain it caused.  I figure that goes with the territory.",

Don't Wanna fall In Love was a pre-cursor pop,R&amp;B tune that was like a blue print for what Britney Spears or christina Aguilera are doing now; brooding funky material with the knack for making it into fun dance music. While Child's inpirations and convictions were steeped into Middle Eastern or Indian religious mysticism (visually) her work was more &quot;Western&quot; sounding in pop nature.The problems with the rest of the tracks for this debut was the monotonous and harsh electronic drum programming and mechanized cold synthesizer sound that kept on repeating itself making the other tracks indistinguishable from each other. It was her semi-raspy rebellious voice that told the listener this lady meant business. Her dark,moody, and somber sounding Welcome to the Real World was nothing more than a sort of social commentary on dreary global events that plague mankind in personal and everday life (crime,hunger,starvation,etc,.etc.).

Best to check Tmobile's 4G\/3G coverage map before buying this phone, otherwise you'll get slow 2G speeds only at 1700Mhz-only areas (this phone doesnt work at 1700Mhz, hence the 2G speeds). Works well on at&T, and Lyca mobile (uses Tmobile for 2g\/3g\/4g coverage).<br \/><br \/>Battery life is very good, around 12 hours with calls and data use during the day.<br \/><br \/>The dual sim functionality works well, with a blue-green color scheme for indicating which carrier is being used.<br \/>Wifi is OK, Bluetooth OK. Processing speed OK.<br \/><br \/>You CANT upgrade the factory installed version of android (4,1) to any of the later android versions.<br \/><br \/>Screen is large and bright, the back camera OK although pictures are somewhat grainy and pixelated when using the flash in indoor use.<br \/><br \/>Altho the phone comes with a basic rubber-type protector, its almost impossible to get a case for this phone. Only one supplier in the US seems to sell spare batteries.<br \/><br \/>THE BIG FLAW:<br \/>Sadly, despite these wonderful features, the phone has a MAJOR flaw that is not revealed in the specs. Although the specs say 2GB of storage, actually after the android operating system etc is installed, you ONLY have 512MB of storage to load apps AND data for apps that cant use a micro SD card. That is, some apps like Gmail need to be in the root of the phone and cant be stored (app itself and its data) on a micro SD card. You thus can only add a few apps to this phone in total. Gmail stops working if the mailbox gets too full as there is no space to download mail.  While some apps can be stored on the micro SD card, you'll only know that this alternate storage is possible when you try downloading that app to the phone: it either stores on the micro SD card or not. If the internal memory is full, you'll have to delete other apps or not install it at all.Skype doesnt work at all, and doesnt even install as there is an error message.<br \/><br \/>In other words, you'll never know whether you can install ALL your favorite apps on the phone, as the limited 512MB internal app storage memory halts the ability and the micro SD storage option isnt certain.<br \/><br \/>The more expense Blu phones like the Life One have more internal app storage, so if you need apps, best to forgo buying this phone and spend extra on the Life One.<br \/><br \/>Blu support in Florida is very good.

You gain all text (attack\/gold\/game text\/Hero Classes) on the card for the bonus play and it does count as an additional card played for cards that track such things. Cheering Crowds can only be used once per card per turn, even though the bonus play would technically give you another Cheering Crowds keyword.<br \/><br \/>Modifies 1 returning keyword:<br \/><br \/>Size-Changing - Originally from Civil War, Size-Changing is always followed by a Hero Class (Strength, Ranged, etc). If you have that matching Hero Class in play, the card with Size-Changing is -2; if a Hero it costs 2 less and if a Villain it costs 2 less to defeat. The mod here is the addition of multiple Hero Classes on Size-Changing; now this keyword can have up to all 5 Hero Classes. For each one you match, the card is -2; so if something has Size-Changing to all 5 Hero classes and you can match 3 with the cards you played, that card is -6. The change makes this keyword a little more dynamic and easier to proc overall.<br \/><br \/>Re-uses the Versatile keyword from Dark City and the Demolish keyword from Villains, representing the first time a Villains keyword has been used in a Heroes expansion.<br \/><br \/>Adds 5 new Heroes and 1 new team, Champions, to which all these Heroes are aligned - Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Nova (Sam Alexander), Totally Awesome Hulk, Viv Vision, and Gwenpool. In my limited games, Nova stood out while Hulk lagged behind, but as this is Marvel Legendary, YMMV.<br \/><br \/>2 New Masterminds - Pagliacci and Fing Fang Foom. Yes, THAT Fing Fang Foom, and he is as monstrous and dragon-y as you remember him to be. Both Masterminds in this set are double-sided with an &#34;Epic&#34; version that ramps up the difficulty, something carried over from the X-Men expansion and what should be the norm, I'd imagine, for Masterminds moving forward.<br \/><br \/>2 Villain Groups - Wrecking Crew & Monsters Unleashed<br \/><br \/>& 4 new Schemes wrap up this set.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/><br \/>- Words cannot express how glad I am that they are finally re-using more old keywords than they are introducing. I've been largely critical of this in the past, and I'm glad to see they've finally done something about it. High time for it, and would still like to see a set with ONLY re-used keywords in the future; they don't lack for options even when doing this.<br \/><br \/>- Another set with &#34;newer&#34; Heroes, I like that UD does go back and forth between newer and older Heroes so we can have an excellent mix of characters in this game. It's going to be hard (or more likely, impossible) to please both newer and older comic fans, and having something for everyone is a good middle ground.<br \/><br \/>- Schemes are much better this set, they are more interesting and fun compared to the bland ones from recent sets.<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/><br \/>- This set is a bit vanilla, I'm sad to say. In our games we found it to be very much status quo but not much beyond that. The new Heroes are fun but the Masterminds largely just sat there without too much threat as we just got stronger over time and beat them down. Perhaps this is the downside to re-using keywords, as it feels like nothing is &#34;new&#34;, but the Civil War set for us largely felt the same and that set introduced a lot of new things.<br \/><br \/>- Epic Masterminds are welcome, but perhaps they can find a way to incorporate the Horror cards from the X-Men set. The Epic Masterminds from both Homecoming and Champions lack in punch compared to the ones from X-Men, with the Horror cards being the major difference; the X-Men Masterminds use them and the others do not. The non-X-Men Epic Masterminds are still pretty tough, but if you make a new card type (Horror) just for Epic Masterminds, then why not find a way to use them?<br \/><br \/>This may sound strange, but I largely feel this set is almost a goodwill expansion after the all the drama surrounding the Spider-Man: Homecoming set. They made all the safe choices with fan favorite Heroes & Villains, returned to using original art, didn't introduce a bunch of brash new keywords, and got rid of the first printing promos that people had issues with. Its very much a return to status quo, and its fair to wonder if that hurt the final product in some way, as perhaps they felt they couldn't take as much risk this time around.<br \/><br \/>The set is solid, if not spectacular, while mostly hitting all the good notes for us at the gaming table, but the buzz wasn't there like it was after our first playthrough of X-Men; its very much okay and doesn't go beyond that. If you have all\/most of the other sets, I'd probably just lean towards skipping this one unless you were starting to get bored or want to take on Fing Fang Foom, which is mostly what got me excited for this set.",

  "text":"I have an almost 4 year-old daughter and an 8 month-old son. I rejoiced the day that my daughter started to drink from straw cups because it is supposed to be better for their mouth and speech development. I started her out on the Munckin straw cups. We LOVED them! We went though many over the next few years. They started to leak through the straw the older they got, but I figured a lot of stuff just starts to wear out. So we would replace them. Then sometimes when there was a dramatic temperature difference between the liquid and outside air, the liquid would come back out of the straw, but hardly ever! So naturally, I decided that I would start my son on the same cups. Only, I had all girly colors\/characters! I was excited to see that they were putting Elmo on the cups now, so I decided to give the new Click Lock technology a try. I have IMMEDIATELY seen leakage through the straw. With no place to review them on the actual Munchkin site, I am reviewing them here. I contacted Munchkin customer service, and they have agreed to send a new straw for each cup I bought (I of course had to get one for my daughter who is too old to really use them, but I did nonetheless). We will see how that goes, but I am not optimistic. So, the whole \"no leak\" claim could be false. The only thing that seems to have changed in the design is the locking rim, but as a result the size of the straw valve has also changed. So that could be a design flaw. For now, I am not happy with this cup and would tell people to wait and see if there are changes to this \"new\" design before purchasing them. I luckily have two or three of the older design. I am only giving it 3 stars because I was able to get a fast response from the company and I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt.",

Wife and I both continued to loose weight but body fat did nothing and even went up.  I measured this against my gym BF% monitor which declined over the same period of time.  I think it is important to know that my wife and I won a gym and understand very well that these things are merely a baseline but it should respond accurately of which it did not.  One of the main reason we purchased was the MyFintessPal syncing and it was very hit or miss.  At times in intermingled my wife and my accounts so on certain days I would loose a hundred pounds and then back up the next day.  Forcing my numbers and timelines to jump all over the place.  Sorry, but I cannot recommend for anything other than a cool overpriced scale.",

I think that is essentially what this is supposed to do, but unfortunately, I do not read any of the languages that are on the label, and they do not come with an English translation. I have worn from anywhere form 10-30 minuets with the same affect.

Instead, it is a simple replacement jack for the iOS device. It works for playback, but not for recording.<br \/><br \/>Short pigtail to plug into iOS device not the greatest for handheld use of iPhone or iPad. Awkward.<br \/><br \/>Plug connection not very confidence inspiring on an iPad 4 with Apple magnetic case. Does not seat firmly, may not be reliable connection for recording. Aggrivated by short pigtail.<br \/><br \/>Analog audio input on iOS is not global with all apps. Some recognize this input, others do not. Dedicated audio progams seem to work fine. I test and confirmed both GarageBand and TwistedWave. The app I purchased this device to use with, however, is hard programmed to use the internal iOS mic only. This bites because we are planning to use AirBeam to broadcast and record a closed circuit feed of some group sessions, and wanted to use a boundary mic positioned on a conference table for better audio. No go. No fault of Tascam, but be advised to test your specific combination of iOS apps with this device. Unfortunately, there is no way to know without buying all the stuff in order to figure out if it works.<br \/><br \/>Wash<br \/><br \/>Some people would downgrade an analog audio interface like this in favor of a digital input device like a USB microphone. My expectations are not super high for a $30 device, but I welcome the option of using something other than a 30 pin connector to connect audio to an iPhone or iPad. For one thing, Apple is depreciating the 30 pin connector, which will render many 30-pin devices to be worthless antiques sooner, not later. For a second thing, my application requires recording video of meetings for 2 hours, and I need the 30-pin so the iPad can be connected to a power supply.<br \/><br \/>Knowing exactly what the capabilties of this device are, buy it if you need it. I'm sure it will serve a lot of people very well, but if not, $30 is unlikely to be a serious mistake.",

  "text":"Normally I tend to skew negative in a lot of game reviews, but I thought Call of Duty: Ghosts was better than a lot of the reviews here made it out to be.  Part of that might be due to slightly different interests.  First, I don't play the campaigns for this kind of first-person shooter, as I'm in it entirely for the on-line multi-player, so take that into account when reading this.<br \/><br \/>The Good: The maps and graphics are really cool and I like the addition (albeit limited) ability to interact with certain pieces of the terrain and environment.  Also, the map size didn't bother me the way that it did other reviewers.  I liked actually having to think about the terrain and use it to my advantage.  Also, there was only one map that I thought was just too convoluted, but every game has at least one map that wasn't thought out as well as the others.  And I liked that there weren't as many choke points on the map, because it discourages people from sitting there with an LMG or the like and just spraying bullets into a particular area all game long.  I liked the number of options for customizing characters, including the new perk system (for the most part), customization of your avatar, and fine-tuning your weapons.  I liked that the use of C4 as an overpowered grenade has been seriously curtailed, and quick-scoping (while not gone) is not nearly as prevalent as it is in the last several COD games.  (Seriously, try playing COD: Black Ops 2 . . . the game is more than 50% quickscopers now.)  And while they still have killstreaks, they don't seem quite as ridiculously unbalanced as they have in previous games. Oh, and I like having the in-game orders that let you get a special care package for accomplishing mini-objectives in the game, and I like the return of Assault vs. support objectives, and that can be customized per weapon combination.<br \/><br \/>The Bad: While the map interaction has improved, it really didn't improve as much as the creators claimed it would.  I would have liked to see more weapons per category, and would like for them to just get rid of the stupid riot shield.  I'm still not sure why they decided to have multiple squadmates that you can get new custom weapons slots.  Each squadmate had to earn experience independently (to get access to perks), but there is a pool of money for all your characters to buy equipment, and all characters are working toward the same overall objectives (so if you accomplish objective &#34;A&#34; for squadmate 1, you can't get bonuses for that objective to help squadmate 2).  Overall, it just seems like a clunky way of doing things.  The biggest issue I have with this game is that it seems to have made spawn camping a little too easy.  I've played games where I was gunned down within a couple of seconds of coming alive for more than half my death count.  From an initial cursory look at the challenges, it doesn't seem like there are as many of them in Ghosts as in previous game, which makes me wonder how much fun the game will be down the road.<br \/><br \/>Still, I actually breathed a sigh of relief after playing Ghosts for a while because I was so sick of the quick-scoping and C4 tossing in Black Ops II.  Ghosts may eventually reveal its own ridiculously overindulgent cheats, but right now its not so bad.  So in closing, Ghosts isn't nearly as horrible as a lot of reviews make it out to be, but there is plenty of room for improvement.",

For some reason, Porco Rosso just didn't do it for me.  It's difficult to point out objectively exactly why...maybe it was the ridiculous villians (they were funny though), or maybe it was the fact that I just couldn't really care about any of the characters, or maybe it was the somewhat dull and abruptly ending story.  As for the last thing, I'm used to Miyazaki's somewhat slow-paced story-telling method, but for some reason Porco Rosso just didn't capture my attention like his other movies.  I just didn't find the movie to be very charming like his others.  Normally, I feel the urge to rewatch his movies, but I don't think I'll be seeing this again.<br \/><br \/>So, do I recommend this movie?  Well, I suggest that all fans of Miyazaki's work see this at least once since it's his.  You may or may not like it; it seems alot of people on Amazon loved it (alot of 4 and 5 star reviews).<br \/><br \/>P.S. To all the Porco Rosso fanboys out there- yes, I know there's alot of metaphors concerning facism and humanity and all that in this movie.

Even though Andy Powell is the only original member who is still in the group, the new band did a wonderful job playing the old classics, and the few new tunes went well in the show.  I got this album shortly after, and I found it to be a nice disc....but it fell way short of measuring up to the old WA!  Most of the tunes are good, but there are a few that didn't quite stack up.  Overall, the album has a nice sound, but none of the guitar solos were long enough.  They spent more time writing more expressive lyrics, and they think that means they didn't have to spend as much time letting the music do the talking without voice.  They do have some nice musical passages where they stop singing and let the music speak.  There are moments of decent WA-style prog rock composition and a few decent guitar solos....but not as many as there should be.  The writing and lyric attitudes have certainly changed, but that is certainly understandable given the personnel changes and just the fact that everyone in the group is older (they're not kids anymore).  That's okay!  In fact, a little change after so many years can be refreshing!  Still, what made WA such a great band in the beginning is that they were a Guitar God band: lots of long guitar solos and prog rock compositions and time where they would stop singing and let the music do the talking.  This album has some of that, but those moments are too few and far between.....and with no LONG guitar solos and a few weaker tunes, the album falls a bit short of my expectations.  It's not a bad album, though.  If you'd like some new music that has SOME feel of the old days and SOME feel of a Wishbone-ish prog rock work, you might like this disc.  It's much better than anything new that kids are listening to nowadays.  Like me, you might find this a pleasant album that's worth playing every once in a while......but don't expect it to measure up to the old Wishbone....because it just doesn't!!",

  "text":"Another example of what happens when the artist compiles a set to his liking without the fan in mind. The fan is the one who is going to purchase this release. Carlos categorized his music (arranged somewhat  chronologically) Soul, Heart &amp; Spirit. The love songs which comprise  disc two (Open Invitation, Bella, Europa, Aqua Marine, etc. should have  been labeled &quot;heart.&quot; They are labeled  &quot;soul.&quot; The  same illogic applies to disc one. The classics Black Magic Woman, Evil  Ways, Oye Como Va comprise the very soul or essence of what Santana is all  about. This is labeled &quot;heart.&quot;<br \/>This is a bad start to this  box. Curious is the fact that those who are devoted fans relish their peak  years (1969-1972) and albums (Santana\/Abraxas\/Santana III). Yet only five  songs are culled from these albums. Soul Sacrifice is an edited live  version as released on Viva!<br \/>The casual fan is looking for a career  retrospective of their classic songs, yet Jingo, No One To Depend On, She's  Not There, Dance Little Sister, Hold On, Winning, Stormy, Well Alright, and  You Know That I Love You are all missing. Carlos may have not wanted pop  songs to adorn this, but if that is the reason...why is The River on  this?<br \/>The serious fan is looking for a wealth of unreleased songs. Except  for a few that appear on disc three (Sweet Black Cherry Pie and Every Now  And Then) the box comes up short.<br \/>The positive notes are the release of  In A Silent Way - (live) and a couple of tracks from Caravanserai. But one  expects more from a box than that.<br \/>The single disc Best Of Santana (which  has been rated far lower than the box) has all but two of the top forty  singles of Santana, and covers the peak years more thoroughly.

They might be ok for games, but I found the low bass lacking, and almost no mid-range at all.  I would definitely not recommend them for movies or music.  There's a reason why Turtle Beach doesn't list the frequency range specs for these.  The PX22's they offer [[ASIN:B00BDS415I Turtle Beach Ear Force PX22 Amplified Universal Gaming Headset]] might be a better choice as they are amp'd, and list a 20-20k frequency range, and are still under $70.",

The size of the pack is nice and compact and good for travel or on-the-go.<br \/>Cons: The quality is a bit lacking. They are quite thin, and can tear easily.

Well, you won't know that until a long way through... and I'm not giving any spoilers.<br \/><br \/>But the story was written in such a manner that I repeatedly questioned what I thought I knew.

  "text":"This movie is nothing phenominal but it delivers EXACTLY what it promises. Gratuitous gore, nudity, and B-Movie level acting. This isn't going to breach my top horror lists, but it's definitely one of the better horror flicks of the 21st century and worth at least checking out.<br \/><br \/>Cons: The gore effects are fairly decent but coulda been better, the characters aren't really all that likeable, and the plot was kinda flawed.<br \/><br \/>Pros: The idea behind a place where you can pay to kill people gives a disturbing viewpoint of all of society being one's enemy (there's no ONE villian in this movie but several), the women throughout are gorgeous (not really all that relevant but a plus nonetheless) and I although some of the characters are cliched, the order of their deaths and how gruesome the deaths are aren't cliched.<br \/><br \/>Overall I enjoyed this movie; it's a good B-Level flick.

  "text":"\"Charlie St Cloud\" features Zac Efron in the title role.  Charlie is an up and coming young adult who has just graduated high school and has the whole world in front of him when tragedy strikes.  The rest of the movie basically involves seeing how Charlie's life is altered and how he deals with his personal misfortune.  Efron, although relying on his eyes to do a lot of the acting, ultimately succeeds in gaining empathy for Charlie's unfortunate loss.<br \/><br \/>This a family film with a special message viewers of nearly all ages will enjoy.  The acting in other key roles is right on, including newcomer Charlie Tahan's depiction of Sam St Cloud and Amanda Crew's portrayal of the girl who captures Charlie St Cloud's heart.  The supporting characters are vividly brought to the screen by two of Hollywood's best: Ray Liotta and Kim Basinger.  Although professional critics didn't provide much praise for this flick, I think audiences will feel differently.<br \/><br \/>The screenplay is well formulated.  Due to various emotional events including love, loss, despair and (foruntately) true happiness taking place, I felt the pace of the movie was actually faster than the 1 hour and 49 minute run-time.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line: If you missed it in theaters, check out \"Charlie St Cloud\" on DVD.

Lee is great as the mummy, brought back to life by the reading of a sacred scroll, and now controlled by a mysterious Egyptian who directs the mummy to go out and kill those responsible for desecrating the tomb of an Egyptian woman whom Lee loved in ancient Egypt.  One of the \"desecrators\" is, of course, Peter Cushing, who in one scene, attempts to blow away the bandaged beast with a shotgun (to no avail, of course!)

  "text":"If any of you had paid attention to the lineup of Desert Sessions albums at all, you would know that the music had gotten weirder and weirder by the release. Those who just wanted music wouldn't really call the last one too accessible. But this volume is accessible. I'll show you how.<br \/><br \/>1. Dead In Love I have a picture that they were playing somewhere in skelaton shirt and pants, until at the end they all play as actual skelatons and at the end of the video, it says Desert Sessions 1988-2003. THe music is all about the enoyment of a sadistic relationship that Jack and Sally couldn't even touch. The best I have ever heard so far on the album.<br \/><br \/>2. I Wanna Make It Witchu: I often found this little number cheesy, if not a sunny beginning. I say that this song seems a lot more accessible than Mark Lanegan's take on romantically strange songs on Desert Sessions 7&8 with \"Covousier\". I may eventually play it, but it ends up getting skipped by me.<br \/><br \/>3. Covered In Punks Blood: A Fight Club with Guitars. You getting dragged across a road that is and isn't finished by a trans-am. That is all you need to know.<br \/><br \/>4. There Will Never Be A Better Time: My 3rd  favorite song. This one has a certain frantic feel of the song as PJ Harvey takes place with her guitar and ghostly voice.<br \/><br \/>5. Crawl Home: The first single off of the album, which I would play sometimes. The video I saw for it was good but didn't really coincide with the song too much, but nonetheless, the song is a bit like it or not. Once you buy the CD you'll be able to tell which direction to go. But I say, I recommend it to PJ Harvey fans.<br \/><br \/>6. I'm Here For Your Daughter: At first, I was so confused because that song that got off to a wonderful start, especially with the guitars, was so friggin' short. But quantity aside, this is my personal favorite and the out-of-whck song that you'd love, too. (If I was allowed to, I would have given you the entire song easily, but I rather you figure it for yourself. It never killed me.) Can you believe this song was performed only twice live?<br \/><br \/>7. Powdered Wig Machine: Imagine you were in England the days of Mozart, wearing those powdered wigs waltzing to this song. Yep, same way. Kind of weird but very good to listen to after a while.<br \/><br \/>8. In My Head...Or Something: The song that most people at the Lullabies To Paralyze page were complaining about. After having listened to both versions, I say that this is a good song, but LOP's version is a lot better. I even mouthed the words on LOP to this song. But nonetheless, this song is a good listen.<br \/><br \/>9. Holey Dime: Very dark lyrics from this one. The personal lyric that kind of affected me a bit was \"sent to He11 on paper wings\/They're all laughing\/...A stitch in time and it's your turn to unravel.\" I'd be too lazy to say this song is about personal fascination with sadism. Alain Johannes outdid himself on this song.<br \/><br \/>10. A Girl Like Me: Polly Jean Harvey back to give us dark view and imagination on relationships. The song was too much on two listens but after having the CD for almost over a year, I evjoyed it.<br \/><br \/>11. Creosote: The fascination with Jingle-Jangle slide guitars is what got me to accept the beauty in blues music. Listen to this, and the jam will be a wonderful experience. You will feel as if you were actually watching the guitarist play the music.<br \/><br \/>12. Subcutaneous Phat: Josh's signature guitar slide comes in to hand you a funk-rock extravaganza from the makers of Desert Sessions.<br \/><br \/>13. Bring It Back Gentle: I wasn't into this song until yesterday. It's OK. The guitar jamming sesion in the middle made it worth my while.<br \/><br \/>14. Shephard's Pie: My 2nd personal favorite experience on the record with guitars and people cutting in to further add the cartoony exterior of animals coming in line to be served some shephard's pie. After that, are just commercials recommending you Rekords Rekords Records.<br \/><br \/>So there you have it. This CD seems a litle more accessible only because this CD has more music than spoken word interludes that filled the last album. Nonetheless, after you buy this, I suggest buying Vol. 7&8. And when you are done with that, I recommend checking out the rest of the Desert Sessions catalog to hear how it all started.",

  "text":"Elgar's cantata\/choral symphony \"The Black Knight\" has that medieval, cinematic feel that's not quite found in other more famous works like his \"Cello Concerto\" and \"Enigma Variations\". It's a 36-minute piece that tells of a jousting during Pentecost. A mysterious black knight (no, not the one with a flesh wound) is undefeated and arrives at a royal feast. But everything he see and touches die (including the King's children), and the king has \"nothing left to live for\". It's a sad story, but the music doesn't seem to make it sad.<br \/><br \/>\"Scenes from the Bavarian Highlands\" has the typical German atmosphere. It's sometimes cheery and lyrical and heavenly, but it's always romantic throughout. My favorite segments are \"Lullaby\" and \"The Marksmen\" simply because they're the most compelling in the piece.<br \/><br \/>Richard Hickox, one of my favorite English conductors, does well here with the London Symphony Orchestra. He takes it all straightforward, never losing track of the overall structure of the two scores. And that makes this essential since there aren't that many recordings of \"Black Knight\" and \"Bavarian Highlands\" around. The orchestra is great, also. Woodwinds and strings have it good. The brass could've improved a bit, but they impress me nonetheless.<br \/><br \/>I seirously recommend this CD to any Elgar fan that's out there (or any classical fan in general). Grade: A-",

  "text":"I discovered the advantages of suitcase packing cubes about 20 years ago. They're splendid for organization, as \"unpacking\" in a hotel room means simply putting the cubes in a drawer; you don't have to hunt for anything since you put related items in the same packing cube; and they make it simple to separate the dirty laundry from the clean clothing. By this point, we've collected at least a dozen such packing cubes, some of which are dedicated to \"traveling kitchen\" (because yes of course we bring along our own coffee gear) or \"winter items\" (so that we Arizona people don't have to hunt for gloves when we head to cold climate). As a result, it was easy for me to say YES when Amazon Vine offered me this set of two packing cubes.<br \/><br \/>...And they're fine. Not astonishing, not disappointing. They do the job adequately.<br \/><br \/>The only oddity is the size and shape of these bags. Most travel packing cubes zip open all the way, so that you can fold items (say, shirts) or flip through them in a hotel room (let's see, which shirt do I want to wear today?). These open up from the top, like a generous woman's purse. You can get into it just fine to sort through your socks and underwear, but it's not quite the same as the open-flat organizers.<br \/><br \/>The construction is good. The bright blue is visible even in a dark space. The size of the bags in the two-pack (one held a week's worth of underwear and socks, the other held my slacks with plenty of room left over); I could have squished in plenty more, if I'd needed to.

Can I say delicious (the bananas are roasted with brown sugar and butter first), but I think personally I'd about half the sugar. When they say light in this magazine they seem to mean reducing fat. So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I'll remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3\/4 cup instead of 1 1\/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I didn't play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and couldn't afford to get it wrong on the first try.

I bought this album, and fell in love with it immediately.  Like the reviewer below said, this is a little bit like an old-school punk record, only a little faster.  The songs on here are powerful, speedy, and loud.  Basically, punk rock through and through.  Yeah, there are a couple slower songs on here, like 'Cut-Ups', but they do the slower songs very well and they don't sound boring or anything, so that's fine.  I think my favorite song on here would be 'Some Nerve'.  It's just awesome.  The song that I really don't like on here is 'Scalped By Pop', because it's your stereotypical 'punk-is-being-killed-by-pop-rock-bands' type of song and I've just heard it millions of times before.  There were punk songs like that in the mid 90's, for cryin' out loud.  Oh well.  Atleast they don't overdo the 'We're punks' thing, like The Casualties, who I hate with every fiber of my being.  So yeah.  If you are a punk, or if you're like me and you just like the punk rock genre, this is a pretty cool album and I would suggest picking it up.

For instance, the \"gunners\" did not capture that sector of Aadhamiya they patrolled: the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force did, and then turned it over to 101st Airborne, and then to the Florida Army National Guard's Warrior battalion (who can be heard on the radio throughout the movie).<br \/><br \/>I was stationed less than 500 meters away from Gunner Main, as we called it. They were by far the most screwed up unit in the entire first armored division. The documentary fails to mention the 25 minute long firefight that 1-36 IN, also stationed at Gunner Main, had.........with themselves. It was all friendly fire.<br \/><br \/>It also fails to mention that the Gunner's on guard duty, shot up our sniper teams from Warrior Battalion, nearly every day, because the gunner's were untrained and unskilled in their professions. They were engineers, and should have stuck doing engineer jobs.<br \/><br \/>The documentary fails to mention any of this. What it DOES do though, is give a great sense of what Aadhamiya was like. You graphically see the discrepancies between Uday and Qusay's palaces, and the slums around the soccer stadium and on River Road. You get a great idea of what the streets were like, how the people reacted, and such. I saw many familiar faces from the streets of Maghrib and Aadhamiya, in Baghdad. So yes, while it's overly preachy towards the troops, and covers their blemishes, it's definately a good documentary....for what it's worth.",

  "text":"This was a fun, flirty, light story. I really appreciated the fact that the author's focus was on the women and their interplay within the threesome, rather than the more common focus on the M\/F dynamic and then having an additional female thrown into the mix. I really liked how different but complimentary the women were with each other. One was clearly more sexually comfortable than the other but there was no shaming or teasing. Their personalities were quite different but they worked well in the narrative. I must also point out that the male character in all this was not the usual overly macho, alpha, jock stereotype. It was refreshing, and added to the intention of the story to focus on the interpersonal play between the women.<br \/><br \/>This will be a fun read for anyone who it looking to cut their teeth on threesome narratives.",

  "text":"The second instalment of this trilogy continues to project some discomfort at both the ages of two the three MCs and also with regards to the sibling relationships. It's a discomfort I'm happy to feel because this is a story that pushes the boundaries and makes you consider what is personally acceptable. There was some degree of fluidity with this for me, as the emotions of Lake and Manning made me reconsider, however, I kept returning to a place of discomfort.<br \/><br \/>The early part of SOMEBODY ELSE'S SKY made for difficult reading with Manning being in a place no one would want to be. I struggled with how he pushed away Lake but he was right to do so. I really enjoyed Manning's introspection throughout this book, it brought a depth of understanding of his roller coaster emotions and baggage, that made me really see him. I still don't like Tiffany much but I do understand why she constantly pushes for what she wants.<br \/><br \/>The eventual pinnacle of this story was somewhat predictable following the prologue and therefore, I didn't feel devastated, I knew all along this was going to be where it would end. Consequently, I wasn't overly upset and just see this as another messed-up intertwining of these three. I am looking forward to reading the culmination of this trilogy and hoping for some eventual peace and satisfaction for the characters.<br \/><br \/>A copy of this book was provided by the author in return for a honest review.<br \/><br \/>Reviewed for Jo&IsaLoveBooks Blog.",

  "text":"My toes (and fingers) habitually get cold quickly and are really hard to warm up without direct heat, and when these are cold it makes my whole body feel cold (although my core is totally warm). My husband bought me heated gloves for skiing (game changer for me!) so when I saw these heated socks I knew I had to try them.<br \/><br \/>They are easy to use without reading instructions. You simply plug the battery pack into the charging cable, which has a splitter and so only requires one outlet. Bonus that it comes with an extra set of battery packs. Once charged, there is a slim cable in the sock to connect the battery into, then you slide it into a pocket at the top of the sock. Looking at this, I thought it might feel uncomfortable, however the battery at the top of the sock did not bother me.<br \/><br \/>What did feel uncomfortable was the tightness of the sock. I wear a womens size 8.5 shoe, which is a very average size, and thought the sock was quite tight. My calves are also average to a little large (but not overly large) and I thought it was hard to pull the sock up to full extension. This said, the warmth they provided to my feet is worthwhile. I did knock a star off since the socks did not have much stretch and felt so tight on someone who is pretty average.<br \/><br \/>What I found interesting, as I took mental notes during the first wear, was that the heating coils ran over the top of my foot, not under, and they did not extend to the toes. Evidently it works by warming the blood running through the veins on the top of the foot. As I stood outside watching a soccer game in 25* weather, I was worried they would not work as my toes were feeling cold at the start and the coils were not running under my toes. However, after a few minutes (using the MEDIUM setting), my toes felt normal - neither hot nor cold. Everyone around me was freezing but I was very comfortable.<br \/><br \/>Obviously these cannot be put into a washing machine, so it takes a some effort to hand wash. This does not dissuade me, but these will primarily be worn on ski days or similar freezing days standing outside watching my kids play soccer.",

  "text":"If you are a fan of Sum 41, then their newest album shouldn't disappoint. This album is pretty similar to their last album &quot;Does this look infected&quot; (DTLI) as it has some heavy guitar riffs and fast-paced punk-sometimes bordering on metal. There is also some rapping in the verses of some of the songs like in DTLI. However, this album has some slower, more mellow songs unlike DTLI. So, if you liked Sum's first two poppier albums but didn't care for DTLI then I wouldn't recommend this album, but to all those who enjoy Sum's last album, I think you'll enjoy this one also. Chuck is a solid 38 minute long album with heavy guitars and catchy hooks. As far as content goes, the lyrics seem to be a little more serious than on prior albums and seem to be more influenced by current world occurences. But it all comes down to the fact that Sum 41 has done what they do best and put out a quality punk album.",

  "text":"Other headphone gear I own:  Sennheiser HD600s + upgraded cables, Sennheiser Momentums + upgraded cables, Schitt Asgard headphone amp, Schitt Gungnir DAC, FiiO X5, Sony Xperia Z2 (w\/ aptX)<br \/><br \/>Design \/ Build Quality:  Very good; the headphones have a premium feel and the addition of different sized ear bud tips and extensions make it easy to get a good fit.  The ear buds themselves do stick out a bit, so these may not be the most comfortable to listen to if you're laying down.  The single button mechanism doesn't seem to physically 'click' or push down so that kind of exacerbates an already sketchy control scheme.  But what I've found is that if I just set the volume up high on the headphones, I can simply adjust it down with my phone.  The headphones come with a rubber strap to sort of tighten the wire connecting the 2 sides, so that helps.  Very comfy overall.  I'm not a fan of the silicon style buds that typically come with IEMs, but the Sony ones aren't too bad.  I purchased a set of Comply TX400 memory foam tips, but I think they're slightly too large as sometimes one tip gets stuck in my ear.  I ordered a pair of the TX200s and will try them this weekend.<br \/><br \/>Sound Quality:  The one compromise I made with this purchase decision was that I knew I'd be dealing with lossy audio.  I primarily listen to Hi Res FLAC (16\/44 --&#62; 24\/192) and then Pandora and Spotify.  I have bluetooth speakers with AptX and I've been impressed with the codec in the past.  You can't really discern the artifacts and that metallic quality that typically accompany AAC\/MP3 files.  These headphones are pretty neutral and bass quality is pretty impressive (I don't mess with bass \/ treble controls if I don't have to).  More than anything, the sound is clean, not harsh, and the background is black (ie quiet).  Sony's done a good job.<br \/><br \/>Connectivity\/Bluetooth:<br \/><br \/>I use use these headphones with my Xperia Z2 phone and my late 2013 retina Macbook Pro 13 and both connect via aptX with no issues.  The range on these headphones is pretty good too!  I can walk around my room and there's no stuttering or cutouts.  Obviously, if you're listening to high bitrate audio and you walk far away from the source device, the connection speed is going to drop.  So there are limits.  I did have an issue one morning at the office where the headphones would connect to the Z2, start playing, and then cutout.  But I haven't been able to replicate the issue.  I tried having a phone conversation with these on and the person on the other line had to ask me to repeat myself a few times - so I think I need to read up on the specifics of using these for phone calls.  So I'll try to update once I check that out a little more.<br \/><br \/>Battery Life:<br \/><br \/>Can't really comment just yet, though the battery just died as I'm typing this.  But definitely these headphones last for several hours.  I've only charged them once since purchasing a week+ ago, so most likely they were due for charging.<br \/><br \/>Overall:<br \/><br \/>So far so good!  I think for $150, the Sony MDR-AS800BTs strike a great balance of sound quality and ease of use.  Yes, the button scheme isn't great, but that's a minor gripe when you get NFC + aptX.",

He's not yet at that 'genius' level of keeping the listener's rapt attention through a 1-hour suite, but he's good. This album (2007) features his compositions in 8 shortish pieces, between 5 and 12 minutes each. The only accompaniment is the excellent pakhawaj drum player.<br \/><br \/>A minor note: Rakesh's last name is misspelled twice on the album cover! Major note: this album is the same as this one: &#34;Devotion Instrumental Temple Music&#34; which is also for sale on Amazon, with a red cover. Here are notes from that one, not present in this album, though the recording is identical:<br \/>&#34;In Hinduism, devotion and worship to the almighty is not confined only to grandiose temples but allows one free reign to connect with the Aatma (the Soul), anywhere, at any time of the day; be it at home, a holy site or simply outdoors. In this album Devotion, the very gifted and talented flautist, Rakesh Chaurasia and the king of Pakhawaj, Pandit Bhavani Shankar come together to create somber yet sublime temple music in Dhrupad style, appropriate for the home or ones own cocoon elsewhere. Eight melodious tracks, beginning with the appropriate dawn Raag Prabhadeshwari, followed by Gerri Todi, Shudh Sarang, Yaman, Jhinjhoti, Main Ki Malhar, Chandrakauns and the late night Raag Jog provide a perfect backdrop to everyday worship and meditation.&#34;<br \/><br \/>The liner notes for this album version under review give some good information, though nothing about the raags themselves. But that information is easy to find online. The westerner will find it nice to hear 8 raags represented on a single album, so if you don't like the tonality of one, just skip ahead to the next one.  :-)  No really, it's a nice 'sampler of raags' album, played on my favorite instrument, and done with skill and passion.",

A young single mom and a man several years older raising his young niece who survived a car accident that killed both her parents have been supporting one another for a couple of years through the single parent\u2019s group they belong to and by sharing childcare duties for their children; she has made it clear she wants more, he is worried about looking like a dirty, old man but one night changes everything in more ways than one.<br \/><br \/>Caleb is use to being in charge due to his job as a lieutenant with the fire department, he is also super protective (honestly a bit overbearing) of his friends especially Lexi who he has vowed to himself is off limits due to their age difference and the fact he needs her in his life to share childcare taking duties with. Caleb as a hero drove me a little bit nuts in that he made assumptions about Lexi without ever talking to her and in fact even made some decisions (demands) about her living arrangements for her and her son when he found out what was going on in her life. He also kept some big news from her regarding his niece which disappointment me greatly. While Lexi may be young, she grew up fast when she became pregnant and no one who raises an infant while attending nursing school, and taking care of another child to boot is meek and weak, in fact Lexi is resilient, strong, and knows her mind and it shows when she lays out what she wants from Caleb in no uncertain terms.<br \/><br \/>With a two year old and a four year old around, these was a lot of laughter, a few interesting tantrums, but also a lot of love. Ms. Nicolas does a great job of keeping the kids\/family time from and center without sacrificing the romance between this couple. As they knew each other so well already, the relationship did move at a fast pace but most will agree it was a long time coming. Lexi had some specific demands that Caleb had to wrap his brain around which led to them knowing each other on a different level and Caleb understanding that while Lexi is quite a bit younger than him, she definitely knows her own mind.<br \/><br \/>As always author Erin Nicholas manages to mix hot and sexy with sweet and innocent making Nice and Easy a delight to read and an excellent addition to this series.<br \/><br \/>Review copy provided for a voluntary review.",

  "text":"For an inexpensive wig, it has a lot more hair than I expected.  I bought this Misty style twice. The color was medium to dark brown, with some red highlights at the top (that wash out after a while, but since it is human hair, you can dye it .) After following directions from YouTube users about co-conditioning, etc., the first one got knotted up very quickly, especially at the nape of the neck, and a bit frizzy. It had a chemical odor that reduced after a few washings.  Still I liked the style and it is inexpensive, so I ordered another. I only wash this second one with a natural, vitamin-infused shampoo, press in a towel, then dry on an open wig holder, and I have had much better luck. I have used it daily for several months and there has been no knotting at the nape or anywhere else.  Is it inconsistent manufacture or did I just over-condition the first one? My guess: a little of both.  Still, for under $40, take a chance.",

This is within tolerance, but not ideal.<br \/>- Cheap plastic housing<br \/>- Small buttons sometimes stick and stay depressed<br \/>- Always defaults to Celsius (minor annoyance)<br \/><br \/>If I had to do it again, I'd probably get a wire probe instead.",

  "text":"I've installed many faucets, and this one is standard fare for pull-down faucets now. It's good looking and substantial, and it does exactly what you'd expect. The flow is well aerated and adequate, and the controls are smooth, including the pull out hose. The only minor hindrance to installation was the number of threads on the faucet base. It's safe to say your countertop isn't thick enough to prevent this faucet from reaching through. Threading the large nut all the way up with the provided tool was a chore, especially with the bowls on my sink intruding on that already cramped space.<br \/>Once installed there are just a couple of things that are noteworthy. First, and least, the faucet spray head doesn't center itself when retracted. It's no big deal, but it may be aimed slightly to the side when released. Secondly, the controls. This will be hard to convey. My current faucets control body protrudes perpendicular from the base, and the handle is at 90 degrees from that creating a natural, user friendly stroke. Pull to the right for more pressure, fore and aft for hot and cold. Now, remember the original Delta single handle joystick faucets? That's how this Pfister operates, but flipped on it's side. I can't describe how this feels in-hand, but it's awkward. When adjusting the temp, it's less like pulling a lever and more like turning a knob. The end of the lever doesn't move much. The action happens at the base of the controls. It's like swinging your hips around while holding your head still.<br \/>I'm sure I'll get used to it, but it's not intuitive. On the positive side, it does have the premium sealing cartridge which will be needed for our particularly hard water.<br \/>Finally, I think this Pfister Tamera is right down the middle of the road for value. Certainly better than a Delta that I bought and returned, but not quite as nice as my current Hansgrohe.<br \/>If you like the aesthetics, you should not be afraid to buy this one.

It doesn't play quite the same. The controls aren't as sharp and there are some bugs in the game (most noticeably in Zephyr and other worlds of the Autumn Plains in Spyro 2). All in all, it's nice being able to play portable, but the controls and bugs can be frustrating. The PS4 experience was more enjoyable.

  "text":"Sid Meier's Pirates is inventive and original.  It has some aspects of the game that I haven't seen in other games.  I like the idea of trying to build up my treasure within a certain time frame (your pirate ages and you can only be a pirate for so long before your health can't take it anymore).  Trying to win the love of the daughters of the Govenors in the different cities is also fun.  The only problem is after awhile the game starts to feel repetitive.  If you are trying to sail against the wind for a long journey, it can take forever to get there (it would be nice if there was a way to speed up the sailing).  Overall it is a fun game, but I have to take long breaks away from it for it to keep being fun.",

And wash your hands with soap and water...thoroughly. The next key thing is aligning it. Make sure you align the FaceTime camera hole as closely as possible. You will get some bubbles. They should slowly come out as you massage each area with a firm circular pressure. As for screen sensitivity I have not noticed any loss of senitivity yet. I use the Apple Pencil gen 2 daily on it.

  "text":"Wow, this is one killer live album.  There is no drums, no bass, no keyboards, no back-up vocals, just a single voice and a single guitar.  Whitesnake has been around just over 20 years since this release, and it  proves to be  one of David Coverdale's finest.  Yea, his voice doesn't have  it's range like it did in the 80's, but he can still melt your heart when  he sings them ballads.  Not surprisingly, that what Starkers In Toyko  contains most of, slow blues burners and late 80's ballads, with a few  newer tunes thrown in.  It opens with Sailing Ships(one of the two here  from Slip of the Tongue), a relaxing rendition that sets the tone for most  of the show.  Slipping next into the mournful Too Many Tears(1 of 3  Restless Heart songs, I also revieve that awesome album), David pouring his  heart and emotion into the song.  About halfway through, from 1987's S\/T  album comes the show rev-upper Give Me All Your Love, and the audience  loving it.  The last three songs are excellent, Is This Love, the heavy  Here I Go(which is about the fastest song performed) and Solider of  Fortune.  The latter being a lovely addition, digging into his Purple bag  of tricks.  As for the guitar player, Adrian Vandenberg(hot-shot 80's  guitar virtuoso) he is fantastic all the way,  not to mention David's  perfect guitar player.  All-in-all , a relaxing, comfortable listen that  will soothe you from a rough day.

  "text":"I was struck by the weight of this speaker.  It weighs quite a bit more than a lot of this type of speaker, which bodes well for its durability.  The two microphones connected right away when I put batteries in them.<br \/><br \/>It had a full charge right out of the box (your mileage may vary), so I turned it on right away to put it through its paces.<br \/><br \/>The speaker cranks up pretty well, not as much as a big-name powered speaker, but it will do as an add-on.  Bluetooth connectivity was a breeze.  In no time, I was cranking out some Prince for my wife, and enjoying the integrated light show.<br \/><br \/>Nice echo and reverb for the mics as well.  I played a little with the EQ and was able to get a really clear, crisp sound from the speaker, while not sounding too bad over the mics as well.<br \/><br \/>My recommendation is to get a better stand.  The included stand was missing a nut, which is right where I needed to crank down the knob for the tripod base.  Even when fully extended (and a replacement nut from my tool bench) the base is not wide enough to offer a lot of stability.  Lost a star for that...it's a big selling point to have the package deal, but when you're gonna have to buy a stand too, well...it kind of lowers the overall price\/value ratio.  If it did not come with a stand, I'd be perfectly happy with what I got.<br \/><br \/>Also, it came with two sets of AA batteries for the mics...but no AAAs for the included remote?<br \/><br \/>A plus to the speaker design, though, is the extendable handle and roller-blade-style wheels, so you don't have to carry this thing around!<br \/><br \/>Overall, a pretty good value and a great speaker!

I wish they would make these \"Enahnced\" CD's so that you can access that info if you want to and not make it a default that automatically pops up every time you put the CD in your disc drive.  It is a real pain to stop everything you are doing and exit out of the \"Enhanced\" features so that you can just listen to the music while you work.<br \/><br \/>Now, on to the music content.  Blessid Union of Souls was one of those bands that I barely paid attention to when they first came to fame.  When I first heard \"I Believe\", I thought it was good.  But the song was overplayed at radio and the social message of the lyrics got a little tiresome after repeated plays.  Other songs that followed were OK, if somewhat forgettable.  In fact, until I bought this CD, I had almost forgotten songs like \"Light in Your Eyes\", \"Let me be the One\", and \"I Wanna Be There\".  I  had pretty much forgotten how many hits this band had.  I like these songs, but they are just pretty much safe, AC\/Rock.  The one song that does stand out from those early recordings is \"Oh Virginia\", which moves a step away from AC and kicks in a little hint of blues.  My favorite songs are actually both from their 1999 release, \"Walking Off the Buzz\".  \"Hey Leonardo (She Likes me for Me)\" was just the song they needed to create some buzz about them and get them back on the charts.  The band really cut loose on this tune and the fun that they had with it really shows through.  \"Standing at the Edge of the Earth\" returns them to their \"oh-so-serious\" mode of earlier recordings, but this one is less boring than the earlier ballads.  In fact, instead of just plodding along like some of their songs, this one builds to a passionate ending.<br \/><br \/>I recommend this CD for \"Hey Leonardo\" and \"Standing at the Edge of the Earth\" and as a bonus you get all of their previous hits.  The one song to really ignore is \"Rev it Up (NASCAR Rocks)\".  An obvious attempt to get played on NASCAR programs.",

  "text":"Fans of Bernstein may be surprised that I call this Eroica, recorded on January 27, 1964, \"Toscanini in much better sound\". Toscanini was always viewed as something of a radical, even a maverick, in Beethoven, and conventional wisdom was that he conducted everything, not just Beethoven (but including Beethoven), too fast and too relentlessly. Bernstein may have been criticized by some in his New York years, but not for those reasons. Yet, if I take Toscanini's famed 1949 recording for RCA, [[ASIN:B00000E6DU Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 1 & 3]] (considered by even some fans of the Maestro too be TOO fast and relentless, compared to some of his pre-war accounts), Bernstein's tempos in the first movement, the Funeral March and the first section of the finale come within seconds of Toscanini's - and it is not always Toscanini who is the fastest. Bernstein reaches the first repeat bar in 2:59, to Toscanini's 3:03 and gets through the first movement (subtracted of the repeat, which he plays and not Toscanini) in 13:53, to Toscanini's 13:44. His Marcia Funebre is at 15:13, to Toscanini's 15:28, with the Maggiore section reached in 4:16 vs 4:13 and the Minore in 6:25 vs 6:24. In the Finale, Bernstein reaches the poco andante in 6:18, to Toscanini's 6:17.<br \/><br \/>But there's more than just tempo: like Toscanini, Bernstein invests the outer movements with sharp and punchy accents, glaring brass, conveying a marvelous sense of explosive exuberance and youthful brashness.<br \/><br \/>Does that make him (and Toscanini) a hard-driven, relentless, maverick radical? Hardly. Those who think otherwise should take a cure of Scherchen ([[ASIN:B00005OLDP Beethoven: Symphonies: No. 3 in E flat, Op. 55 \"Eroica\" \/ No. 6 in F, Op. 68 \"Pastoral\"]]) and Norrington ([[ASIN:B00005A9O0 Beethoven - Symphonies 1-9 * Overtures \/ London Classical Players * Sir Roger Norrington]]) - and take a look at the scores as well. It is a well-known fact that Beethoven's metronome markings are always - not only in the Eroica, but there too - insanely fast, so much so that generation after generation of musician have deployed treasures of imagination to find reasons not to observe them: that they were added years after the composition; that the metronome was defective; that he didn't know how to use it; that he was deaf and the tempo you hear in your inner self isn't the same as the one when the music is actually performed; that the music is unplayable at those tempos; and so forth.<br \/><br \/>But just take the tempo indications of the Eroica: \"Allegro con brio\" (first movement), \"Allegro vivace\" (scherzo), \"Allegro molto\" (finale). NOT \"allegro ma non troppo\", or \"allegro moderato\", or \"moderato\". How faster can you get? \"Allegro precipitoso possible\"? Beethoven wanted them brisk, explosive, teeming with energy - the energy and sweep and turmoil of the revolutionary ideals. Except for the Scherzo, that's how Bernstein, after Toscanini, plays them.<br \/><br \/>On the other hand Bernstein's funeral march, like Toscanini's, is far from fast, and considerably slower than Beethoven's metronome. He imbues it with great pathos, but less violence than Toscanini. But for Beethoven's tempo, go to Norrington. It is fascinating: what may be lost in pathos is certainly gained in the real sense of a forward-moving march, and hearing it at Beethoven's tempo it is easy to imagine that the composer drew his inspiration from his vivid experience and memory of the funeral processions of the the great fallen heroes so frequently staged when the French revolution swept Europe away.<br \/><br \/>Where Bernstein strays from the Toscanini model is in the Scherzo: his will shock no believer in the German tradition. His very moderate tempo, hardly faster than Furtwangler's, gives it the character of a good-natured and somewhat heavy-footed hunt in the forest (and the middle trio with horns has great character), like a premonition of the Pastorale, rather than the breathless race indicated by Beethoven's metronome, or the wild dance of the elves played by Toscanini at an even faster tempo.<br \/><br \/>But Bernstein hurls with great turbulence and agitation in the finale, and his theme and variation develop at a brisk pace and lively mood, reaching uplifting intensity and drama in the climaxes. Again: Toscanini in much better sound. Like everybody else before Norrington he does take a traditional view of the \"poco andante\" section starting at 6:18 - slowly paced, far slower than Beethoven's 108 eighth-notes, grandiose and triumphant in the climaxes. It is entirely convincing on its own terms. Go to Norrington to hear what it sounds like when played at a tempo closer to Beethoven's - it completely changes the character of the music. But Bernstein's coda is something of a letdown, way too cautious, and despite the wonderful pungency of the brass, it fails to generate as much excitement as it should.<br \/><br \/>Despite these few reservations, this remains a profoundly satisfying version, one that I regularly return to, with those of Toscanini and Leibowitz ([[ASIN:B000003GDM Symphonies No. 1 & 3]]), as a possible yardstick. Great sound.<br \/><br \/>The two overtures would seem like a fine bonus, for a TT of 65:30 - but I guess that, at one point in his artistic life, Bernstein grew tired of being Toscanini in much better sound (it does burn a lot of energy). His Egmont-Overture is from 12 February 1970 and it is a comfortable and grand reading, but it lacks the intensity of Toscanini's. But that's nothing compared to his Fidelio-Overture (January 31, 1967). I listened to it immediately after hearing a number of recordings made before it, Bruno Walter in 1934, Weingartner in '38, Toscanini in '39 and '44, Reiner in '55, Munch in '56 and Boult in circa '58, and although it pains me to say so, Bernstein is a near-disgrace. It doesn't start well: the two opening orchestral explosions are thick and lumpish rather than explosive. In the ensuing Adagio the balances are entirely wrong, when come the two bars of explosive woodwinds and brass punctuating each beat at 1:25 you hardly hear them, they are thick and don't punctuate anything. Then comes the Allegro, and it's all geniality, but no drive, no explosiveness, dynamics compressed - is that really what Bernstein intended, or is it my early CBS Masterworks' transfer? But I didn't hear any compressed dynamics in the two other pieces. And not just \"impressions\", mind you: Weingartner, Toscanini, Munch, Reiner all took the Allegro section in 2:51 to 2:58; Boult was more laid-back, at 3:05. Bernstein? 3:25. Did he have enough of Toscanini by 1967 and was he trying to be Klemperer for a change?<br \/><br \/>Doen't matter. The Eroica alone warrants the purchase of this CD, or of its subsequent reissues.",

Btw, the best way to use the powder is to either wet your toothbrush first, or after you have applied a strip of your toothpaste, and then dip into the powder.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I like this whitening kit a lot, and I appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into creating this set.

  "text":"I got this book from the Vine review list because I was familiar with the author, Daniel Goleman, and his books on Emotional Intelligence.  This book is different from those books in a number of ways.  One is that it seems designed to be used in a classroom.  It is well organized for this purpose, with bullet points, summaries, items in colored boxes, and even questions for discussion.  The book does not disguise this purpose either and it is a good one.  The book would fit well into this context and be well designed for this purpose.  The book has some echoes of the Buddhist roots of the author, who draws some of his language from Socially Engaged Buddhism (\"Socially Engaged Eco-Literacy\").  What I liked about his other books is that he defined several different kinds of intelligence, with emotional intelligence being one that our culture should ideally cultivate more than it does.  It seems that he is defining another intelligence that he is labeling \"eco-literacy\" and is wishing to find a way of educating people in this intelligence.  I would have liked this intelligence to be highlighted more in this book and put more front and center.  It seems, instead, to be hiding below the factual material and the presentation of environmental issues.  I am not sure if the book could have been written otherwise.  Maybe eco-literacy needs to bring in all this factual material to develop itself, but I would have liked the intelligence itself to be explored a little more directly.  For this reason, I give it 4 stars rather than 5 stars.  It is still a good book.  It seems that this book is an attempt (and a good one) to encourage educational institutions to teach eco-literacy, just as his other books have inspired them to teach emotional intelligence.<br \/><br \/>What I did like and what I have also discovered from other books is that stories work better than statistics.  It seems that a good story can unify a lot of factual information and give it objective and emotional relevance, while statistics are so easily manipulated these days that is often hard to see what they mean in a larger context, whether they are reliable, or whether the single item that they refer to even enough of a picture of what is going on when so many factors create the world that we know.  In this regard, there are some well chosen stories and examples that help develop eco-literacy.  There was, too, a nice summary of how to share this eco-literacy with others that does encapsulate some good social and emotional intelligence (as well as create an environment where eco-literacy can be learned):<br \/><br \/>> Don't communicate from a place of anger.<br \/>> Reach people on the human level through stories.<br \/>> Foster dialogue instead of debate.<br \/>> Speak from the heart.<br \/>> Make ecological connections clear to others.<br \/><br \/>I have been learning to do this more in my life and having these goals named should help focus and accelerate this learning even more.<br \/><br \/>In my own studies, I came to the conclusion that environmental awareness had challenges presenting itself to a world used to \"modern physics\".  The proofs generated within this scientific community are usually \"single line causation models\", like F=MA, where you isolate a chain of relationships using Standard Temperature Pressure and other attenuations, and are then able to prove the equation by relatively easy to repeat experiments.  A certain kind of intelligence does very good with this kind of experimentation, thinking, and modeling.  But environmental studies in some sense do the opposite, they are trying to predict how an ecosystem with thousands of causal factors will evolve or devolve, and then predict the environmental impact of a human incursion into this ecosystem.  Given this kind of research, it is almost impossible to have comprehensive modeling and precision predictions that would constitute proof for a \"physics\" and legal mentality.  It is always possible to point to other factors and blame them, so that the human factor can be exonerated.  Or people can point to how nature recovers itself by X number of years and use this as an excuse to exploit the resources and then leave nature alone.  By now, there is enough human experience with all this to start getting a reasonable idea of what can and will happen, how long it takes nature to really regenerate, what it needs to regenerate, and how to start factoring unforeseen consequences, and even developing an instinct about when and where they are likely to appear.<br \/><br \/>Unlike the physics model, again, nature does not have \"standard temperature pressure\" behind it, but undergoes uni-directional change over time.  Besides the evolutionary succession leading from deserts to forests (and how it may not be easy to skip over the thousands of years of intermediate steps between them after a strip mining operation is done), there is the nonreversible impact of, for instance, asphalt roads paved all over the entire planet and how they are heat sinks and hold heat within them that would have otherwise dissipated quickly (easily seen when soft snows come, land everywhere to produce a white landscape, and yet melt on the roads), and when combined with other factors can add up to new long term factors that affect the planetary ecology.  It requires a kind of intelligence that can think in terms of whole systems, convergent multiple causes, probabilities rather than certainties, and respect that any modeling is bound to leave out possibly unforeseen relevant factors.  With probabilty thinking there is a risk assessment about what is worth moving an economic project forward on which then dovetails with social and political intelligence.  A small section of the book entitled, \"Beyond Our Collective Blindspot\" does touch a little bit on the \"physics model\" approach and how it does not add up eco-literacy.  It focuses on how the need to quantify in numbers (and statistics) may not add up to learning the larger picture that is needed.<br \/><br \/>The book does seem to touch upon some of what I wanted it to, which was to name an intelligence and define some of its characteristics and contrast it with other kinds of intelligence (and how the single line causation approach may confuse the issue rather than help understand eco-systems).  It is more lurking in the background of this book between the lines and only named more directly in a few paragraphs here and there.  I did carry this expectation from his other books and so it may not be fair to bring to this one.  But others might be tempted to do the same for the same reason.  To be fair, I gather that the intended classroom curriculum probably needs all the factual material and stories to create a certain kind of conversation about the subject and perhaps it is here that the eco-literate intelligence is meant to grow.  The book is intended to be primarily used as a classroom text.  My feeling is that it detracts a little from being read outside this context.  I still like the book, but was expecting a little more (in the notes in the beginning of this book, another book is mentioned by the same author called ECOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE: THE HIDDEN IMPACTS OF WHAT WE BUY, I suspect that this book is more of what I was expecting and that this book is more about bringing the ideas into the educational system).<br \/><br \/>There is a summary of the main themes of eco-literacy that does highlight the purpose of this book:<br \/><br \/>> Developing Empathy for All Forms of Life<br \/>> Embracing Sustainability as a Community Practice<br \/>> Making the Invisible Visible<br \/>> Anticipating Unintended Consequences<br \/>> Understanding How Nature Sustains Life<br \/><br \/>The book does stay faithful to developing these themes well.",

Lia is scarred inside and out, and these scars rule her life. A life that is now in danger in Costa Rica. Cav is former SEAL working security whose mission right now is to keep Lia safe. An unexpected attraction is almost immediate, a need to get to know each other when they meet. Cav is very intrigued by Lia, and Lia finds herself beginning to trust him and feel comfort from him. Mixing business and pleasure can be difficult, but somehow Lia and Cav do just that. A romance slowly and steadily grows, just as the suspense and intrigue of the danger Lia is in grows. Will Lia feel safe enough to trust herself and Cav? Can Cav keep Lia safe so that they can leave the past where it belongs and take control of their future?<br \/><br \/>I enjoyed getting to know Lia and Cav. I liked these two characters.

This also happened with just the Atoto and the stock speakers and no new amp. It also didn\u2019t happen with the original radio. Like many car head units, the EQ and DSP section is not the best. A lot of harsh digital artifacts in the sound when used.<br \/>All in all though, the sound quality is acceptable for a car.<br \/><br \/>A couple of features I don\u2019t like are:<br \/>The always changing colors for the screen and button. I haven\u2019t found any way to get it to stop. This is typically \u201cRETAIL MODE\u201d on other units. It is distracting.<br \/>The spectrum analyzer in the music app is strictly for show.  It does not represent the music playing. The lows and highs are boosted in all music playback even if you cut it down all the way. And it changes color constantly as well.<br \/>If there is a fix for either of these, please let me know. I haven\u2019t found one in the manual or on line yet.<br \/><br \/>Features I do like are:<br \/>Incredible flexibility.<br \/>Back up camera on a 10\u201d screen.<br \/>Front and rear camera inputs.<br \/>Upgradeability.<br \/><br \/>I hope that it last for at least 7 years and that I will be able to upgrade it over those 7 years. Longer would be better.  It should for my $600. I also would like to see improvements made to these types of units in the future.",

  "text":"To be quite honest, I originally bought this album b\/c my curiousity got the best of me. As a fan of Peter Green in his Mayall &amp; Mac days, &amp; being quite aware of his situation, I knew I wasn't going to be getting this disc to hear that tone out of his Les Paul that KNOCKED me out.<br \/>And I was right. But I also enjoyed this album considerably. No tone, no Les Paul, but this is a great disc if you really enjoy the acoustic blues like I do. It might be me, but this is some of the CLOSEST covers of Robert Johnson one will likely hear...anywhere. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I was blown away by the actual &quot;feel&quot; they achieved to the original recordings of Po' Robert in the 30's, which is a challenge in its own right.<br \/>I really don't know what Green played on these sessions, &amp; from what I hear, he enjoys playing the harp &amp; some guitar while Nigel Watson handled much of the soloing. But again, that isn't a bad thing. His voice has aged exceptionally well through the years (especially for the material they played).... &amp; it was just great to hear that Peter Green was back playing &amp; making music again. But make no mistake: the music is excellent on this album. Very ironic that Peter Green makes his way back, playing Robert Johnson songs...",

Sound on this Lp is a continuation of a big, lush string orchestra, and Boone softly croons his sedate easy listening song choices with the instrumental emphasis on a bank of lush, soaring strings, flutes, harps, restrained swing brass, and some Mancini-like continental harmonica work.  In the '50s Boone generally copied Bing Crosby on his slow ballad albums, but by the early '60s his style softened towards a soft crooning style more suggesting the romantic vocal caress of 1928-1934 Russ Columbo, with backing in the range of Henry Mancini pop.<br \/><br \/>Three and a half stars.

Both games are ver great but i am writing a review about Frontline.<br \/>So if all you gamers want some tips here are some tips.  This is not one of those games like Splinter Cell were you do all of that (...) secret stuff.  This game dont try to hide from your enemies because they already know your coming.  They are not the hardest to defeat but have your chalanges.  This is a very crazy war game were you always have some action and always have to be watching your back!  You have some of the coolist guns because you are way back in the day.<br \/>I dont really care for the multi player because ther isnt much to do besides verse your friends(which can get really boring).  Unlike Rising Sun you cannot allow the com. to verse you in multi-player,and you can not do a campaign with  a friend.<br \/>Overall great game highly recomended,very fun,great graphics,very funny, and doesnt allow you to put your controler down!",

  "text":"Lux brings us a deliciously dark story shared from the voice of\u00a0eleven-year-old, Roger Knightley. Before our story ends, he will have to face his fears and use his\u00a0wit if he and his family want to survive. The story has a rather large cast of characters and references many a book and lore. With its atmospheric tone and villainous characters you are quickly pulled into the story.<br \/><br \/>The living cast of characters are easy enough to keep track of. We\u2019ve got family members, staff and unwanted guests,\u00a0 but the family tree and those of the supernatural realm made my head spin. I wish the book had a reference guide. I recommend writing them down as you hear a name or most importantly\u00a0a nickname. Don\u2019t let this deter you though because Lux takes us on quite the journey as Roger tries to keep his cousin Havelock (Lockie) from harm. He is added by\u00a0his cousin Travers and his valet Bellows. Travers resides at Deadmarsh full-time and Bellows is a former boxer.\u00a0Kip, the family cat is an important part of the story, but alas spoilers dear reader.<br \/><br \/>What I can tell you is that there is a curse of sorts on the Havelock family and it has something to do with the heir turning eleven. The mist appears to be alive and the servants have left. When, Roger arrives expecting good times with his cousins thing have changed. Travers, the bastard daughter and sibling of Lockie is dressed like a Duchess and behaving oddly. Worse, his cousin Lockie bring with him his schoolmaster and is behaving oddly. Worse yet, they have moved him into a damp, dreadfully dark room.<br \/><br \/>It took me the better part of a week to devour Deadmarsh Fey, as I tried to unravel the secrets of Deadmarsh and determine who was friend or foe.\u00a0While engaging and filled with colorful characters living, dead and other, it is a story that demands one's full attention.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>The setting itself added to the tale with the unrelenting mist, rundown condition of the gardens, decay and the woods and moor that surrounded the property. Lux has a vivid imagination and I could feel the cold manor floor and dampness seeping into Roger\u2019s bedchamber. Without spoilers I will tell you we slip between the veil and see a glimpse of what was.<br \/><br \/>I loved the tension created by Lockie\u2019s approaching birthday and the encounters with strange creatures and the dreaded\u00a0Blood Wood. I've always feared the fae and Lux reminded me why. We encounter all sorts of twisted creatures and demons. I loved how the author brought them to life and gave me goosebumps.<br \/><br \/>Roger was a clever boy, well versed in books as I imagine a lonely young boy of this era would be. He was quick to piece things together and trusted his gut even when he wanted to give up. I enjoyed his transformation in the book as his confidence grew.",

  "text":"[[VIDEOID:7a402459b658c3d0977e3923e8c3b5ba]] I really struggled with this product\u2014literally.  As design and quality of the flaps, I love them.  They look OEM and they are a nice combination of stiff ABS around the frame and softer rubbery material on the flaps.  The stiff frame articulates well with the Tesla\u2019s trim and looks great.<br \/><br \/>But\u2026<br \/><br \/>The first problem is there are no instructions.  AT ALL.  There is not a lot to this product.  There are four flaps\u2014two front, two rear\u2014and two bags of button-style locking clips.  Each bag has 6 clips, which is good because they break easily and you only need 2 per flap, or 8 total.  The right and left flaps are mirror images of each other.  The two bags of clips are different sizes from each other.<br \/><br \/>Since there were no instructions I first searched up installation videos of similar products on YouTube.  I highly recommend doing that before you begin.  Take aways from that:<br \/><br \/>1. There are clips in your Tesla that need to be removed (and you should save them) before installing the flaps.  You can easily figure out which ones by looking at where the holes are in the new flaps.  Then the flaps are set into place over the holes and you use the NEW supplied clips to attach the flaps.  There is a small side bracket built into the flaps that grabs trim on the side of the car as well. Kind of slide that in place.  The original clips are easily removed.  They are a pin inside a larger slotted cylinder.  The end of the pin causes the outside of the cylinder to expand when you push the pin in.  So once the cylinder is all the way in its end is pushed outward by the pin and it is held in place.  There are two little slots where the pin touches the top of the cylinder. Put a small flat-head screw driver into the slot and gently turn the flat-head of the screw driver, pushing the top of the pin out and away from the cylinder.  Then the whole thing just slides out.  Sounds complicated here but it\u2019s super simple.  By the way, these go back in easily in reverse order, with a satisfying little click when they\u2019re in place.  (I know this because I had to repeatedly abort installation and put everything back.  More on that later\u2026)<br \/><br \/>2. There is an added brace piece on the rear flaps that attaches under the car. You need a 10 mm wrench to carefully remove a bolt in that location.  Then that bolt is RE-USED.  The reviewer I watched really emphasized that you need to be gentle with that bolt.  Do not cross-thread it or over-tighten it.  Note how tight it is when you remove it the first time.<br \/><br \/>So, installation should be super easy.  Take off clips and 10 mm bolt.  Put flaps in place.  Insert new clips and replace bolt.  Right?  The clips need to be a little longer than the originals to account for the thickness of the flaps.  There was no obvious logic to it looking at the new clips.  (By the way, save and LABEL your original clips as you take them out.) I could not get them to stay in place.  Some broke as I was trying to install them and then remove them again.  They are much more brittle than the original clips.  Eventually I contacted the seller who eventually told me the LONGER set of clips are for the FRONT.  Not sure why that is true.  They are much longer than the original clips in that location, but OK.  They did work, although I\u2019m not 100% confident one of the four is locked in.  On the rear flaps, I could just not get them to lock in place.  I eventually gave up and ordered a different product.<br \/><br \/>So my original conclusion was this:<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m going to say 3 stars\u2014generously.  The flaps are great, but lack of instructions\u2014even in the Amazon listing\u2014and the crummy clips make them useless, at least in the rear.<br \/><br \/>BUT\u2026 The new product I ordered from a different company turned out to be exactly the same, down to the embossed codes on the flaps.  But it came with SOME instructions.  So I tried again, in warmer, brighter weather.<br \/><br \/>I was able to get the rear set installed without breaking any clips and without cursing much.  So I will upgrade this review to 4 stars since the product works and seems quality.  Still taking off one star for the brittle clips and lack of instructions.  I have made some video of the rear installation to help others.  I think the key is aligning everything, then starting with the innermost clips (thank you, new instructions!) and, if needed, interlocking the ring and the pin one click, then putting the whole thing in to the whole and pushing hard to get the 2nd click.",

  "text":"I was stunned to see WHO played Patrick Bateman in this movie.  One of my favorite films of all time, &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; (see my review if interested) starred a fourteen-year old Christian Bale with a heavy English accent.  What happened!?  He's all grown-up, hunky, and quite the convincing actor (even the accent is gone!).  I thought this movie was good.  As I have stated in another review, this book was banned in places accessible to me during my high school years.  I eventually read the book to discover that it was quite a work of art, often reminiscent of &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;.  The movie adaptation is well-done, even though it left out much of the gore of the printed edition.<br \/><br \/> The story takes place amidst the decadence and hairspray atmosphere of the 80's.  Patrick Bateman(Bale) and his friends are obsessed with women, money, great restaurant reservations, and themselves.  Patrick's whole existence is identified to us by his lifestyle.  He is obsessed about everything from his skin care line to his business cards. He is perfect and seemingly normal to his peers.  However, this hunky, wealthy, &quot;perfect&quot; guy has a big secret: When this Wall Street yuppie is not trying to get into &quot;Dorsia&quot;,  NYC's finest restaurant, he's an insane serial killer.  Patrick lives two lives that have only one thing in common...his obsession for cleanliness and perfection. Is he truly insane, or are we all?  It's a rough question to ask yourself while peeking into his behaviors through night and day.<br \/>The ending leaves us a bit confused. It seemed rushed.  I can't give it away, but it leaves some questions to toss around for hours after finishing the movie.  I thought performances by Reese Witherspoone (&quot;Legally Blonde&quot;) and Chloe Soveigny (&quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;) were well done. In all, this is a great film to rent. I won't recommend purchase. I think the extreme gore would probably, in my opinion be a little tiring after a while, but I must say, I couldn't get enough of Patrick Bateman's constant sarcasm.  He has some lines that are so laughable, you sometimes forget this is a Drama\/Suspense or Horror in most video stores.  While not a perfect &quot;date movie&quot; (my own sarcastic attempt), &quot;American Psycho&quot; is sure to please if you have a good sense of humor.  I can't wait to see what movies Christian Bale will choose in the future.  He has done well painting the tale of a psychopath with excellent taste in food and ties.",

The updates to the adapter and to the GH5 only improves it more and more. BUT; the biggest con for me is the noise of the autofocus for video. The autofocus gets me well enough, there are random ghost focuses sometimes. BUT I use my adapter for vlogging because I cant manual focus holding my camera on myself. Even with a rode mic, the whirling of the autofocus is in the audio and it sucks to have because its so noticeable. Having the autofocus find the subject really fast is so game changing but for video, the whirling kills it almost, I just have to walk around with an external audio device and its just more gear to lug around.<br \/><br \/>Otherwise the  pros are stellar. The magnification allowing more light in is a huge plus. Your aperture for Canon lenses get close to the actual light you would get on a full body. Be able to change the aperture in body too without having to put the lens on a canon, changing the aperture, and then back to the GH5.

  "text":"By 1986, Yngwie had definently deserved the acclaim he was receiving from the guitar community.  With 2 classics firmly under his belt and a growing reputation as the premier rock guitarist, Yngwie had truly re-invented the wheel!  TRILOGY follows mostly the same pattern as the previous MARCHING OUT with the glaring exception being the overall &quot;pop-ness&quot; of the disc, possibly to widen his audience.  And, to his benefit, he did with the now standard &quot;You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget&quot; featuring quite a fine solo and the great vocal stylings of Mr. Mark Boals.  Quite befitting Yngwie's ever present Dungeons And Dragons vibe, Boals' thin, high, shrill seems right at home with the minor key madness of such uptempo shredders as &quot;Liar&quot;, &quot;Fury&quot;, and &quot;Magic Mirror&quot;.  Anders and Jens Johannson return while Yngwie grabs the bass on this one.  We are treated to the emotionally charged instrumental &quot;Crying&quot; as well as the vocal tinged mid-tempo &quot;Queen In Love&quot; and &quot;Fire&quot;.  The trudging &quot;Dark Ages&quot; is also quite a gem on an album that really saw Yngwie lean with the glam moving times of the mid to late 1980's (possibly the only time Yngwie leaned with the times in his whole career!  He truly stands by his invented neo-classical style, but it is obvious that this record was a slight departure from the raw satan-esque vintage metal of his earlier recordings).  The true classic on this record, and what really sends it home with a four star rating instead of a 3 or 3 1\/2 is the epic majesty of the title track, &quot;Trilogy Suite Opus 5&quot;.  A true high point in Yngwie's career, this instrumental reminds us of why we listen to this guy in the first place and totally is on par with &quot;Black Star&quot; or &quot;Far Beyond The Sun&quot; from his first record.  Yngwie had truly solidified himself as the master of his art and with TRILOGY, he reached a broader audience while still staying true to his artistic muse.  Quite a feat!  A true guitar classic as well as being a metal masterpiece.",

  "text":"We just recently re did our kitchen with new countertops, sink, faucet, garbage disposal, and a RO water filtration system. We were hiring a plumber to get everything hooked up since it was too complicated to do all of that by ourselves. I can't speak on how easy\/hard it was to set up this water filter but it is up and running, working great.<br \/><br \/>I am happy with the water flow, as our old one was barely giving us a cup of water each time. The unit looks good under the sink, and is pretty much standard like all of the other RO systems I've installed in my home.<br \/><br \/>I think my only complaint is I got the UV version, which it seems is unnecessary for use with city water. I thought I was doing a good thing by getting the best version for the cleanest water but as it turns out, the UV makes the water smell funny. It is like a sweet smell, or even like that smell when your fridge has different food in there, and you open it up and get a whiff of all that stuff mixed together. I usually use a cup to get water from the filter and when I smell the cup, the scent is there. However, when I drink it (nose closed), there is no taste. Basically, it tastes fine but smells funny. The smell does not go away and it will be there for as long as you have the water. I haven't been able to drink the water because I don't like smelling it while I'm drinking it out of a water bottle. I've only been using it to cook, or for hot tea (boiled). Customer service has suggested for us to try to bypass the UV portion but I haven't looked at the manual or figured out how to do that, since we didn't do it ourselves.<br \/><br \/>I did measure it with a TDS meter and the water was around 44. I am happy and satisfied with that aspect, but I'm not happy about the smell of the water from the UV. I wish I had gotten the cheaper version (a somewhat significant price difference), and would have been happily drinking the water by now.",

  "text":"This is a good wireless headset. I can only compare it to the Corsair VOID and the Logitech G930, but it's superior in build quality to both, has punchier sound than both, has a more manipulative microphone than both, and the software plays a little better with the user than either of them. The VOID is inferior in almost every aspect except apparently the microphone on the VOID is a little better, according to my buddies. The G930 has better &#34;fake&#34; 7.1 surround sound than the Arctis but feels more open, so you lose a lot of that punch. The G930 is also nowhere near as loud as the Arctis is, nor is the bass as pronounced but it has better mid-ranges even without fussing with the EQ, whereas the Arctis pretty much requires it to be messed with.<br \/><br \/>The Arctis does have a small issue and one major issue. The small one is that the surround sound does sound absolutely god awful in some games and applications, but overall it seems to be pretty good. This one would be hit or miss. The major issue is that the pads on the ear cups are absolutely unacceptably poor. They're not very thin but they compress to being almost flat, with a very thin amount of fabric between you and the speakers, you're basically rubbing your ear against plastic that's being compressed to your head. It's seriously inexcusable how awful they are, but the good news is that there are varying ways to remedy the issue. I've done a temporary fix until I can find a better material by cutting up an old shirt to match the size of the cups and inserting the shirt material underneath the actual pads. No noticeable loss in sound quality (for someone who isn't an audiophile, at least) and significantly increases comfort.<br \/><br \/>Pros -<br \/><br \/>Very crisp sound, but you'll have to dial it in for your tastes.<br \/>Very sturdy construction.<br \/>Software is quite good, does it's job.<br \/>The two different output sources is very rad, and being able to balance them is even cooler.<br \/>The mic can be easily manipulated and placed where you need it to be.<br \/>Has better volume ranges compared to the VOID and G930.<br \/>The elastic band makes the top side of the headset very comfortable.<br \/><br \/>Cons -<br \/><br \/>The sound is going to take some time to actually dial in, the flat EQ is more flat than you'd expect.<br \/>The surround sound is hit or miss, and when it misses, it misses very badly.<br \/>The ear pads are a war crime, even if easy to remedy the issue.",

  "text":"\"Think Tank\" was the first Rollins spoken word album where it dawned on me that Henry had really hit the mainstream. Unlike Rollins' early spoken word albums, \"Think Tank\" was recorded in a theater, not a small club. Not to mention the pictures on the inside of Rollins decked out in dress pants and dress shoes in place of his usual laid back appearance. Not that any of this is necessarily a bad thing, but it was a little jarring for me as a long time fan. On the positive side, Rollins sounded extremely well prepared on this album and in my opinion it was at this stage of his career that he really started to perfect his craft; it was obvious that his years of spoken word experience were paying off. For instance, if you play this album back to back with \"Big Ugly Mouth\", the contrast is striking. Rollins was really starting to blossom as a storyteller on \"Think Tank\", and this is evident particularly on the second CD where he describes meeting a dying fan on the track \"Marius\" and talks about his experiences while visiting Russia. I also liked the way Rollins split the material up, with the lighthearted material on the first disc and the longer, more serious material on the second disc.<br \/><br \/>On the downside (for me anyway), \"Think Tank\" began Rollins' trend of political commentary which has continued to this day. It is a pet peeve of mine when any entertainer starts spouting off about their political affiliation or political opinions, regardless of what their views are. I would rather hear Rollins speak about his life's experiences than listen to his opinions on Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. I do have to give him credit though, on the track \"World Peace\", Rollins makes a statement that America has gotten too comfortable and in his opinion we could be attacked at any moment and we wouldn't even know what was happening. I found this to be a very poignant statement considering that \"Think Tank\" was released three years prior to 9\/11, and it really caught my ear when I listened to that track post-9\/11. All in all, \"Think Tank\" to me represents a turning point in Rollins' spoken word career, and stands up as one of his best spoken word albums.",

If you are going to try to sleep in the same room with this unit running - I have a couple of gotchas to note.<br \/><br \/>The bright blue all-clear light - horribly bright.  It bathes the room in a cold blue glow.  I have lessened this simply by placing that side directly against the wall, but there is no reason why the light should be this bright.  It would be better if there were no light.  I think that I will be getting some black electrical tape to completely cover this - but that ruins the look of the unit.<br \/><br \/>The alarm that sounds when it runs out of water - is shockingly loud when you are sleeping.  Scared the life out of me.  No reason for any noise at all - the light changes from blue to flashing red - this is enough of a signal.  Waking me up at 4 am with a blaring beep (louder than my alarm) - is simply not needed.  The system stops working at that point, anyway - so why wake a person up to let them know?  Silliness.<br \/><br \/>I don't want to knock it down to 3 stars - but as a bedroom unit running at night - it gets about 2 stars.

  "text":"From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance<br \/><br \/>At A Glance<br \/>I loved the unique concept and dark feel to Dust. I was glued to the pages, I just wish more happened.<br \/><br \/>The Good<br \/>Here's The Story...<br \/>Rosalie is a young, energetic pixie who loves to spend her time with mother earth. That is until she is enslaved by fairies and used for free labor making pixie dust. In this pixie prison, Rosalie sees horrors and desolation beyond comprehension. Almost driven to the point of madness, Rosalie attempts to escape. But is soon captured and punished with isolation and torture. But Jack, her fairy guard, is different from the other fairies. He's kind and supportive and cares for Rosalie more than he would like to admit. He is resolute in helping her escape but Rosalie's growing feelings for Jack make her hesitant to leave him behind.<br \/><br \/>From Darkness to Light...<br \/>I read the summary of this book and was like, \"Fairies? Pixies? Am all over it.\" And yes, they were all only inches tall. So. Cute. But then I started reading the book and I was like, \"Oh, not so cute. More like dark, sinister, and heart-breaking.\" And I liked the book so much more for it. This is not a fairytale, this is a story about slavery, pain, endurance and love. Strange combination, right? But it worked. And though this story is dark, it also has light. Jack and Rosalie build this relationship in a dark hole of despair and find solace in one another.<br \/><br \/>Rosalie...<br \/>Rosalie was so spirited and energetic in the beginning. She didn't quite fit in with the rest of her people, but she found a place for herself within the plants and flowers. Her world was ripped from her when she was taken. She had known nothing but friendship and peace until she was introduced to starvation, non-stop manual labor, and death. The pixies in the prison die often from overwork and desolation. Rosalie held out for a long time. I was proud of her, but the air of hopelessness does finally catch up with her. It broke my heart to see her become like the rest of the catatonic pixies. Then the motherly figure, Juniper, builds Rosalie back up. I loved Juniper, she was so gentle and kind. She gave Rosalie her will to live back.<br \/><br \/>What Happens in the Hole, Stays in the Hole...<br \/>It was even more heartbreaking when Rosalie was thrown in a dark, deep hole where she was tortured repeatedly with the breaking of her wings. I could feel the pain she was going through with Ashley's descriptive writing. I was so relieved when Jack came into the picture. It seemed like there was no hope before him. At first, Jack was not very likable. He was a spoiled brat who treated Rosalie like trash. But we soon learn the truth behind his bad behavior and his caring for her makes the reader start to love him. Jack and Rosalie go through things no one should have to go through. Ashley did not hold back on the indignities of imprisonment, which made the whole experience that much more realistic.<br \/><br \/>So Much More...<br \/>The writing was mesmerizing and detailed. I could picture every scene in great detail be it beautiful or horrible. The pixie\/fairy aspect was so fun. It changes a lot of the dynamics because these people are no more than 7 inches tall. The the ending was both heart-breaking and exhilarating. And it stressed the crap out of me. I was so nervous and then Ashley had to end it at a vital part, so you can't wait to read the second book. There is so much of the story left to be written. I can't wait for book two.<br \/><br \/>The Bad<br \/>There is nothing big that I didn't like about this book. But there was a sense of...lacking. As if something was missing. I think not enough happened to wow me. For me, something substantial must happen to make me say a book is amazing. But Dust focuses on the day to day happenings of an imprisoned pixie...and that's it. I'm hoping the second book really picks up.<br \/><br \/>The Snuggly<br \/>This is a very clean book. The relationship between Jack and Rosalie hasn't even scratched the surface in Dust.<br \/><br \/>Final Thoughts<br \/>Dust is like no other fairy book I have read. It's a perfect mixture of dark and light. It takes you down a dismal path that will leave you aching for the characters, but you know there has to be a happy ending somewhere. Or at least we can hope. A very recommended read.<br \/><br \/>Quotes<br \/>\"Why can't our existence be like the stars? Happily twinkling and dancing in the night sky, bringing light and entertainment to all who see? The stars make everyone ponder unanswered questions, makes everyone smile. And no matter who you are, where you are or what you've done, they're always there for you. No matter what.\"<br \/><br \/>*****<br \/><br \/>\"My name is Rosalie. I may be smaller, I may be weaker, but I was born free, should die free. You will not take this from me.\"",

Because he isn't pummeling ear drums with Earth Shattering chords and sounds created via Electric Guitar? Grow up...<br \/><br \/>Rage Against The Machine was never about \"how hard can we get\", but rather the message, which seems to get lost in between all the angst filled and \"the heavier the better, the more we will rebel\" kids of our generation.<br \/>It was all about the message, which in my opinion is largely lost among our force fed MTV high consumerism society.<br \/>These ain't pop songs kiddies...<br \/><br \/>I remember in High School, all the kids reveled over \"Killing in the Name\", mostly due to Zach's freak out at the end of the song. AS if these kids really know anything about what Zach is portraying. All they hear is swear words and lyrics of rebellion, heavy rap\/metal and all of a sudden they think their rebels?<br \/><br \/>Sorry kids, but Tom Morello's One Man Revolution bears the same heaviness and raw grit as did all of Rage Against The Machines albums.<br \/>Heaviness and raw grit is a state of mind and more of a feeling than a presence and a sound. Personally, I feel that One Man Revolution hits as hard as anything RATM has ever done.<br \/><br \/>Each song features Tom's Gruff voice croon about freedom and revolution (what else?), and his guitar, while played only on acoustic, is amazing nonetheless. There are some deep and meaningful lyrics are written by Tom himself. Lyrics no doubt come from the heart.<br \/> And the guitar is soft, soothing yet fierce in its intention. One Man revolution reminded me of why I feel that Tom Morello is one of the BEST guitar players alive.<br \/><br \/>The album comes off as a folk\/country sort of feel, but this ain't your daddy's folk! This music could spark a revolution and then some.",

  "text":"For those looking for a serious high current application, this device needs to be modified. The 14GA wires are only tacked onto the PCB so with some thermal stress these will break away causing problems. The way to assure full current can be handled is to use an external 75A 75mA shunt (which is 1m-Ohm). You must also modify the meter by opening it to remove the internal shunt which is a surface mount resistor. It's easiest to unsolder the resistor using two soldering irons, one on each side. Soldering skill is required. The device has a hi-res A-D converter with more than 4 digit resolution which is a lot of precision but my wattmeter wasn't terribly accurate, maybe 5% off, so don't assume it's accurate down to the least significant digit. People are correct in noting that it is unipolar - it only measures current one direction. You can reverse the measurement direction manually with a 2P2T switch on the wires coming from an external shunt. Or for the price you can just order a second unit and sharing the same external shunt, install it in the opposite direction. Looks like the easiest way to reset the counters is to briefly cut the input power to the meter. You don't need to turn off the load if you have an external shunt. Final comment, unit is not well sealed to the elements. You need to silicone up the gaps and add a clear plastic window over the LCD screen to prevent dirt & moisture from getting in.",

  "text":"Not bad for a general overview of how things are going with your water parameters. I was skeptical as to whether or not these strips would react at all, so I staged a little test using high ammonia foods (salami, cheese, peanut butter) and high nitrate\/nitrite foods (bacon, some cold cuts). I took about a tbsp worth of said foods and made a \"tea\" out of them, steeping them in about 3 oz of boiling water for 15 minutes. After letting the water cool completely, I dipped the strips and sure enough, the results came up for ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites. While cycling my tanks, I saw very subtle jumps in ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates. And when I had a mini-cycle incident a little bit ago, these strips clued me in (I had a sudden 1.0 jump in nitrites).<br \/><br \/>As for the gh, kh, and ph tests, I do occasionally have trouble with the colors in the test pad running a bit, but not enough to significantly affect the results. And when my kh and gh started dropping (and I have very soft water to begin with), this test was able to detect that, allowing me to get the specialized gh\/kh test and correct the issue with crushed coral. The results from the strips corresponded with the results from the specialized tests.<br \/><br \/>Some people might suggest not buying test strips, and instead just going for a master test kit. Now having set up two tanks using these strips, and later purchasing some of the specialized tests, I have to disagree. While having more detailed results sounds great, by and large, what you need is a general overview of the conditions in your tank. Doing all the specialized tests takes quite a bit of time, and when setting up a tank, you have to be ready to test daily for at least two to four weeks. The more complicated testing is, the less likely you are to commit to frequent testing and the greater the chance that it will go by the wayside and your creatures will suffer. These strips are convenient, accurate, and if later you feel you need more specific information, you can invest in the particular tests that you need. I opted for gh, kh, pH, and nitrate tests, and the results from these strips have always corresponded to those tests. (Also, the master test kit does not include gh\/kh, which are important parameters to keep an eye on.)<br \/><br \/>Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase.",

  "text":"4 stars--BEAR ATTRACTION is the latest novella in Jennifer Ashley\u2019s contemporary, adult Shifters Unbound paranormal, romance series focusing on the shifters from Shiftertown USA.  This is human Shifter Bureau liaison Walker Danielson and Kodiak bear shifter Rebecca. BEAR ATTRACTION can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. As per Jennifer\u2019s style of writing, many of the previous storyline characters and couples play a secondary and supporting role. Any important background information is revealed when necessary.<br \/><br \/>SOME BACKGROUND: Approximately twenty years earlier shifters were exposed to the human population. Out of fear, discrimination and specieism, the shifters were collared in the belief that it would control aggression then forced into segregated communities known as Shiftertowns. There are several Shiftertowns located throughout the world where shifters live in a relative but strained peace amongst their own kind. But once in awhile, a shifter crosses into human territory and the resulting upheaval is handled by the government\u2019s Shifter Bureau. Not all shifters were caught under the Shiftertown ordinance; some remain free and un-collared, while others go rogue and feral.<br \/><br \/>Told from third person point of view, BEAR ATTRACTION finds Walker and Rebecca working together on an assignment. Technically, Rebecca is under Walker\u2019s custody because she trespassed onto human-owned land and the Shifter Bureau frowns on any shifters leaving their assigned territory. As part of Rebecca\u2019s punishment, she must aid Walker in the search for a missing human female known to frequent shifter bars posing as a shifter groupie. What ensues is a foray into shifter nightlife where our couple finds more trouble at every stop. Even amongst shifters there is discrimination against different kinds.<br \/><br \/>There is a prior history between Rebecca and Walker; an attraction that finds our couple secretly desiring one another but a desire that has never been acted upon.  Throughout the storyline, their attraction builds; there is an overriding need to protect; and the mate bond growing stronger. The $ex scenes are limited but the sexual tension is high-so great that the other shifters sense the mate bond before Rebecca and Walker admit it to themselves.<br \/><br \/>The secondary roles include many of the previous storyline characters including some of the younger cubs and children. We get an up close look into the shifter\u2019s personal lives, their loves and their families; as well as the introduction to several new characters and the possibility of a shifter breed not previously known to exist.<br \/><br \/>The world building continues on the theme of discrimination and prejudice against a species because of their differences. Fear is rampant within the human population, perpetuated by the Shifter Bureau whose aim is to control with intimidation and collars.<br \/><br \/>BEAR ATTRACTION  is a fast paced story with a little bit of suspense, mystery, romance, fun and $ex. Jennifer Ashley\u2019s wonderful and passionate family of shifters are a tight knit community where shifters of all species have been welcomed into the town but there is no denying that safety is a matter of degrees. BEAR ATTRACTION is a welcome addition to the Shifters Unbound series and a go-to read every time.",

  "text":"Ok, so the thing i'm tired of reading is comparisons to Hysteria and Pyromania. Those albums are 21-24 years old, those were the bands glory days, and you cant expect them to get back to that. What you can hope for is new stuff thats good, and can still be popular. What you will notice with most of the songs on this album is that they can sound older yet sound modern at the same time, if that makes any sense! I personally think this is the best original album they have made since Adrenalize, and if you can beat all the albums But the greatest ones thats pretty good.<br \/><br \/>I really like the first 5 songs a lot. \"Go\" is one of, if not the hardest song I have heard them produce. Great way to start of the album saying \"Hey! We can still be hard and heavy!\". \"Nine Lives\" I was worried about when I heard that Tim McGraw was in it (I don't like country) but luckily he only sings the first verse and apparently helps in the chorus but I cant really notice. Another good rock song, that has been getting a fair amount of airplay on a local classic rock station. If only some of the other stations would pick up a song or two from the album it may stir some popularity, especially the next song \"C'mon C'mon\". This is probably my favorite track on the album. \"C'mon C'mon\" is very anthem like, and I can totally see this playing on any of the the top 40 stations. Great windows down summer song! The next song is \"Love\" which, being a huge Queen fan, I like very much. Just as others have stated this song is kind of unusual and the chorus ooohs and ahhhs sound eerily like Queen (did they secretly steal these from them? lol). The song starts off slow, speeds up a little, has a nice little guitar solo in there, and a little bit of strangeness. I could totally see Freddie Mercury singing this way back when (if you are a Queen fan, think \"Love of my Life\" \"You Take My Breath Away\"  \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" \"Inneundo\"). \"Tomorrow\" is next, its a pretty modern sounding pop\/rock song which again, I could see playing on the radio.<br \/><br \/>After the initial 5 songs, I think the album gets somewhat weaker, but its not bad. \"Cruise Control\" sounds a little to much like the Slang album for my tastes. \"Hallucinate\" is fun to listen to, but sounds a little bit like its trying to hard to sound like the hits of the 80s. \"Only The Good Die Young\" and \"Bad Actress\" are ok, don't have much of a review for them cause I haven't listened to them as much as some of the others. \"Come Undone\" is probably the weakest track on the album, and finally \"Gotta Let It Go\" is another ok song with a rock chorus that sounds like it was taken right out of Bon Jovi's \"Have A Nice Day.\"<br \/><br \/>Overall a pretty good effort, best I have heard since the early 90s. A couple of the latter songs could be better but they are still enjoyable and the album is quite short. I think the album is worth it for the first 5 songs themselves. I really hope some of them catch on and get played on the radio to give the band more exposure than just for the classics.",

This unit came with one bad safety sensor and therefore wouldn't work properly for over a week. Genie's support was almost non existent. The team at Amazon finally stepped in and sent a complete new unit. Swapped out the bad sensor and it works fine, do not use Alexa, so haven't tried to set that up. One last point - the remotes are problematic, I think you have to hold the button until the door starts to move which is not instantaneous, unlike my old unit.

They first met two years before in Austin and after a very heated encounter, Violet fled the scene. Nico moved to NOLA a year ago, and has done everything he can to become Violet\u2019s friend since she will not allow anything else. As a Werewolf, Nico knows who she is to him, but Violet has other ideas<br \/><br \/>Violet made to risky mistake of reading her own tarot cards and ever since, has been keeping Nico at arm\u2019s length despite the intense attraction between. She thinks the cards foretold of a bad relationship for them. Not only is Violet attracted to Nico, she wants to help him and all wolves manage their untamed violent other halves by using her magic in tattoos. Ever since they were cursed by a witch, the weres have been outcasts, mostly shunned by all other supernaturals because of their uncontrollable natures. What Violet is trying to do for Nico and his cousin, Mateo, gets out to Nico\u2019s old pack bringing them to town making trouble. And werewolf trouble means violence.<br \/><br \/>Violet is one of those frustrating characters whose stubborn nature and refusal to see the truth despite, ironically, being a powerful Seer gets irritating at times. Nico is too nice really, putting up with all her misdirection, mixed signals, and pushing him to the brink because his wolf knows Violet is his mate; they are tired of waiting for her to realize it. Nico is also a talented singer who performs at the family pub so he spends a lot of time around Violet which is tortuous. The Savoie sisters make up this crazy witch family, each of them having special talents and skills including Violet\u2019s twin who is very much the opposite of her.

  "text":"Title: Not for Profit<br \/><br \/>Author: Glenn Shepard<br \/><br \/>Genre: Thriller\/mystery<br \/><br \/>Review<br \/>Not for Profit, written by Glenn Shepard, is part thriller, part mystery and a lot of heart pounding action. This novel is very engaging and kept me on my toes the whole time. The characters were very dynamic and it was interesting to read the story from both the protagonist and the antagonist's point of view.<br \/><br \/>The main character is a plastic surgeon named Scott. Scott is a very talented surgeon with an affinity for orchids (something that often crops up in the novel). He has a good heart and always puts the care of his<br \/>patients before earning a profit. Herb Waters, his former classmate and teammate from high school football, is a different story. All Waters is interested in is making money and he will do anything to get it--including \"borrowing\" money from the community hospital.<br \/><br \/>Scott and Waters haven't been in touch for several years, even though they both work in the medical field in the same town. Waters is the head of the local hospital he has been taking advantage of; Scott runs his own<br \/>private clinic. The two men rarely--if ever--cross paths. However, Scott begins to see a lot more of Waters than he would like when Scott is accused of two murders and Waters is urging the mayor and detective Harris to arrest Scott even though Scott is innocent.<br \/><br \/>Now, add a mysterious person called Alpha Charlie, a woman named Keyes who is more than she seems, the CIA and a terrorist group and you have a plot\/mystery with so many twists and turns you just might get lost in<br \/>it. As I mentioned before, the book was told from more than one perspective; actually, it was told from many points of views. As I might have mentioned before, I start to get a bit confused if a book I'm reading is told from more than 4 characters' POV. And although Not for Profit was definitely told from more than 4 POVs, it wasn't too confusing for me. I think it was because about 50-70% of the book was told from Scott's point of view.<br \/><br \/>However, one thing that I think should be noted is that the novel switches from 1st to 3rd person limited and 3rd person omniscient. That didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, since I usually like consistency in the books I read.<br \/><br \/>The last third of the novel was very jam packed with action. The chapters were quick and kept the plot moving at a rapid pace. The chapters were divided into smaller sections that tells readers when the POV is going to<br \/>switch since some chapters are told from multiple POVs.<br \/><br \/>I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fast paced mystery and thriller, particularly if you like trying to solve the novel's mystery as clues are presented as you read.<br \/><br \/>Likes:<br \/><br \/>  *I really liked Scott's character<br \/>  *who Alpha<br \/>Charlie was (you'll get this once you read the book--Alpha Charlie is one sneaky<br \/>guy)<br \/><br \/>Dislikes:<br \/>  *Stating the obvious a lot of times (ie. I could hear the wheels spinning in the mud. It was<br \/>stuck!)<br \/>  *too much exclamation<br \/>points...I don't know why it bothers me but it does<br \/><br \/>***note a free copy was given in exchange for an honest review***",

  "text":"Put 4gal of chemicals through it to coat the outside of my house in pesticide since Mississippi is heavy on the bugs. Also allows me to keep the dog in the house for the night while the chemicals dry and seap in. Took two fills, even though the bottles I was using were 1.4gal, I was mixing two brands together. Anyways, two refills, 2560-3200 sq feet covered with the fan tip on took less than an hour to cover the whole house (it's a rather large house, 4700sqft, 3200 is the wall coverage, did 8-10ft up since I don't really have a huge upstairs bug problem). And I was being rather liberal with the usage. Would say the range was rather well maybe 3ft max and a decent amount of pressure too. Will definitely be using this to weed kill also.<br \/><br \/>Clean up was easy. Didn't do it as suggested. Filled the canister up 3\/4 water after pumping the last bit of pesticide out. Closed it, swirled it around, and then dumped the water out. Filled it up again, practically full this time. Turned on the device, locked the wand into position, and ran it until it emptied, which takes about 20-30 minutes at the full 4 gallons.<br \/><br \/>There are, however a few things of annoyances that could make this a better product:<br \/>1) put the switch on the handle or the strap, since as it is now, you kind of have to have it off to turn it on.<br \/>2) I didn't notice a battery indicator anywhere, which would be nice, preferably on the handle of the wand. You know 3-4 tiny leds.<br \/>3) Belly\/waist buckle also.<br \/><br \/>Final thoughts; I like it. I like that the battery compartment is nice and large meaning you can easily store the extra tips in there so as to not lose them. I assume that's why there is so much space in there. The padding while not a lot, is actually sufficient. The nearly an hour of use with it, didn't feel like anything was digging into my skin or had to readjust ever. I thought I only paid $75, must have been thinking about the manual ones that I looked at. SO, at this price of nearly $160 those suggestions should easily be implemented in the next iteration. I like it, was amazed how quickly it allowed me to take care of the house and really coat it in 4 bottles in such a short time. I also failed to mention the pressure release valve, wished it was a little more obvious what it was, dye it red or something, or make it more button like. I intuitively figured it out, but it's not super obvious. It was only because it was impossible to screw off the lid due to the pressure build up. Good product.<br \/><br \/>Note to Amazon: What's the deal with your \"rate features\"? 9 times out of 10, most of them are irrelevant options.  How is \"sheerness\" and \"thickness\"  relevant here?

  "text":"As a smart controller, it works well, has both web-based and mobile app. Overall a solid device, some issues will hopefully get resolved through software upgrades.<br \/><br \/>If you expect you will need more zones, a great choice; it is cheaper and better looking than others. If you value more software capabilities, or need multiple controllers or sharing access, go with Rachio[[ASIN:B01D1NMLJU Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller, WiFi, 8 Zone 2nd Generation, Works with Amazon Alexa]]<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>For me, what distinguishes this controller is the fantastic industrial design - small things that are really well thought-through:<br \/>- it is expandable - if you need to add 8 more stations, just buy the add-on plate; no need to buy a whole different controller (and manually move all settings -  it can save you a lot of $ and hours of reprogramming!)<br \/>- wires are easy to insert remove (even though the opening for the bundle is a bit tight)<br \/>- convenient always-on wire for testing the wiring\/valves during installation (well done!)<br \/>- has a built-in level (small thing but helps when mounting)<br \/>- modern looks (should have quite a bit of appeal to trekkies, too!)<br \/>Overall, very well thought-through mechanical aspects<br \/>Note that you do want to mount the base plate solidly to the wall, as it takes quite a bit of effort to separate the body from the base plate (use all screws, put drywall anchors if attaching to drywall)<br \/>Another really cool capability is that it can be programmed directly from the device using the built-in screen and scroll wheel - this is more of an insurance (when would you not have your smartphone?); however, if the house loses internet connection, you can still adjust some basic settings, adjust watering restrictions, etc.<br \/>The turn-and-push wheel is a bit unusual at first but it really works well (some other reviewers noted problems but at least my device was solid)<br \/>Also, if you have to install outside, the outdoors mounting box is reasonably small (vs. e.g., Rachoi's behemot) and much better looking; it also has an integrated key lock.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>The screen seems a bit cheap\/lo-res. Another minor shortcoming is the very sharp corners\/edges - it can hurt you accidentally and it will probably dent easier (e.g., if someone leans a shovel on it)<br \/>I had some problems with the software - after I put one of the zones on a slope, the watering time jumped from 10-15' to 45'; when I corrected back to flat, nothing changed, this zone stayed at 45'. It was not corrected even after a couple of days. I am sure these things can be worked out. I did not contact tech support, where this may have been resolved. The mobile app seemed not to have been updated for a while.<br \/>I had an initial problem with setting up networks (it would not recognize my network, even though there was nothing unusual\/no weird characters in the name); I was able to connect to a different network and upgrade the firmware; once done, everything worked OK (incl. connecting to the network it was failing to attach to before).<br \/>Another possibly significant limitation is support for multiple controllers (required a call to tech support) and lack of sharing access (if you want to give your gardener access to adjust the schedule\/water).",

  "text":"Being that I can't stand drinking plain water, when I saw this set available from Vine, I requested it and here we are. This review is for: Twinings Cold Infuse Fruit Flavoured Cold Water Enhancer \u2013 Pack of 2 Cold Infuse Water Enhancer (12 Enhancers)...<br \/><br \/>First regarding the cold water enhancers. There are two flavors the strawberry-lemon and the mango-passionfruit. These are absolutely freaking delicious! I detect none of that funky aftertaste I've gotten with other flavor enhancers in the past. These score a perfect 10 as far as flavor.<br \/><br \/>The bottle on the other hand, I don't really care for. I think the logo and saying are kind of silly and I would not use it outside of the house. People would probably ask what Bundle Monkey is and since I have no clue, I'd rather avoid the situation altogether. The infusion part of the bottle works and works well though, so there's that. I have another, albeit smaller, water infusion bottle and I most likely will use that one more often.<br \/><br \/>Thing is though, you don't even really  need an infusion bottle, you could just toss one of these into your bottle or glass and let it steep for a few moments. The longer you let it steep the stronger the flavor is, and if you like that flavor, you can add some ice and really savor the taste for a while. The taste of these is really the star here, take or leave the bottle.<br \/><br \/>The only other thing is that I do think this is rather pricey. There are 12 infusers in each jar and that does help to justify the price. I'm not sure I will buy it again. I will finish off the ones that I have and then decide.",

  "text":"I love this series and waited very impatiently to read this book, in fact at the end of book two I stupidly read the teaser and I don't do well with teasers. After reading the teaser chapter I was that much more excited about this book. AND then I stupidly read everyones thought and opinions about this book and I read so many of them that I knew I couldn't read it yet. I have no problem reading opinions about books in fact I love doing that but when there is a particular book that is much anticipated and everyone reads it and talks, and talks, and talks about it it does something to me. I like info. on books but then there is a point that I have to much info. and other opinions that it almost taints mine. So I set this aside on my kindle knowing I would come back to it but also knowing that if I wanted to enjoy this one I would have to wait and let my brain settle. And then the other day I looked at this book and started another book but I couldn't get this one out of my mind so I knew it was finally time to read Until Lilly.<br \/><br \/>Lilly and Cash met and quickly fell in love but Cash's past indiscretions finally caught up to him when he found out one of his past &#34;acquaintances&#34; was pregnant with his child. What Cash didn't know was that Lilly was also pregnant with his daughter. When Lilly got the texts from Cash telling her he didn't want their baby and to get rid of it she was devastated but raised her daughter with all the love in the world. Years later when Lilly and their daughter went out to play Lilly never would have guessed she would come face to face with Cash.<br \/><br \/>Cash always did a double take when he saw a red head so when he saw one while playing with his son he is shocked to see Lilly and then he comes face to face with his daughter who looks just like his son and is furious that Lilly would keep her from him. When Cash learns the truth and he is more determined than ever to not only get to know his daughter but get Lilly back in his life and make up for lost time. Weary and scarred Lilly is cautious with her daughter and her heart but when you never fall out of love with someone it isn't hard for them to cement themselves back into your life.<br \/><br \/>As Lilly and Cash and their two kids make a life for themselves they easily get back to the happiest time in their lives but Cash's ex hasn't changed one bit and she has no problem making their lives as difficult as she can and now Cash and Lilly will have a fight on their hands to not only have a happy life but to have a life together.<br \/><br \/>**spoilerish(small)**<br \/>what I didn't like about this story was that yes it wasn't Cash's fault that Jules got pregnant(kind of) but you pick crazy even just for a &#34;lay&#34; you get dun dun dun..... crazy I know surprise, I would have liked Cash to have worked harder to get Lilly back. She loved him yes and I completely believed he always loved her but it was just too easy for him and I would have liked to have scene him grovel more. My other thing was that I wished Cash and Lilly had had another baby I get it many people are happy with two kids but Lilly went throughout he pregnancy all alone Cash missed years of his and Lilly's daughters life while stank in Jules got it all so I wished that Cash and Jules had been able to experience a pregnancy together and a baby together in fact I was so sure that would happen and I was so excited for that to happen that I was really surprised when it didn't.<br \/>**end spoilers**<br \/><br \/>Having said that There was a lot more that I liked than didn't in this book. Cash was a great hero Lilly was always it for him and he never stopped loving her, he was possessive and loving and so gentle with his kids. Lilly was a great heroine she made a life for her daughter and was a great mother and she was very kind and forgiving. I also really liked their kids they were funny and just added more to this story, and we also get everyone from book one and two in this book as well as a glimpse into book four Nico's book (which I can't wait for) I again could not force myself to wait to read the teaser chapters so now I really, really want Nico's book I love the bad boy thing so he is very anticipated for me. Aurora Rose Reynolds again did a great job of pulling me into Cash and Lilly's lives and their story like always. This is one of those series that is so easy to love.",

The only area of disappointment was its inability to remove the crankshaft pulley bolt on a Toyota Camry. I know they tend to be torqued on pretty tight but I know the bolt wasn't torqued at 450lbs ... the torque rating on the Milwaukee.  Ever other 14mm nut and bolt on up wasn't a problem removing. My driver came with 2 battery packs with a button indicating the charge status of each battery. Very convenient when wondering when the battery needed a charge.

Here, I thought, was a character with some depth.  Moving through his life trying to adhere to a set of principles values while, at the same time, also struggling with his inner demons - now that's a flawed hero I can identify with.  I found this movie at my local Blockbuster, loved it, and have since bought it and the two other Jesse Stone movies that are currently available.  I think Tom Selleck did a much better job in these movies than he ever did in his 'Magnum PI' series.  I'm also anxiously awaiting the DVD release of the fourth.

  "text":"I will only talk about the second half of this show briefly; if you want a full-fledged analysis, hop on over to the first collection and see what I have to say there. Anyways, I call this show a &quot;Pop of the Year&quot; because it was one of THE big anime to hit television...in the year it was made. It made waves, and then the fuss died down a little. This is quite different from classics like Death Note and Code Geass, where the obsession continues, and more along the lines of Kill la Kill and Steins;Gate; there was hype, the show enticed many more than just fans of the source material, and the love subsided when the show was over. One can always ask why it didn't last as long in everyone's hearts, because Akame ga Kill definitely had the potential, but here's where it falls flat:<br \/>Any attempts at creating deep emotional connections turn out tremendous flops<br \/>Unfortunately, in a world where everyone is a killer and there are so many characters to dissipate our attention and the ACTION is the focal point of the whole series, we are left with a mere thrill ride. It is beautiful and engaging, but it lasts a mere 24 episodes; this is not long enough to develop characters when all they do is fight. Not only that, Akame ga Kill does not take itself seriously. The two classics I named, as well as the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood work so well because they take everything about themselves seriously, and therefore the emotional portions are taken seriously by the audience. There are jokes, no doubt, but the underlying tone is one of realism, and therefore goofy moments are meant to lighten the mood, not set the tone. Akame ga Kill does not do this, the same way Kill la Kill does not. However, Kill la Kill was meant to be goofy, while the former ends up seeming so despite its best efforts. And where does that happen? Mostly in the second half. You see, this part 2 collection is what divides everyone with this show, and where they try to make us feel for the unfolding events without giving them time to unfold. Confusing deaths? Check. An unexplored love? Check. A battle where we do not really care who lives or dies because both characters are cool, but we are not emotionally drawn in by their exploits? Check. Akame ga Kill was very disappointing because it could have been more than it was. Some people throw this phrase around, but it really is sad to think of how different it could have been if this was character driven instead of action driven, and had a bit more seriousness to the premise. It's a good show if you enjoy bloody action, magic powers, and your typical anime shenanigans, and I highly recommend it, but it is most likely not something that will leave you with a hole in your heart, inspire you to do something great, or push you to ponder everything you know about the world. You'll like it while you watch it, but then you'll easily move on with a dry mouth thirsty for better. Take my word as you see fit.",

C.W. McCall\u2019s deadpan C.B. craze cash-in Convoy and Dave Dudley\u2019s deep voiced anthem Six Days On the Road should be familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever owned a radio.  Johnny Horton\u2019s rowdy Honky Tonk Man and Roger Miller\u2019s pop crossover anthem King of the Road aren\u2019t 18 wheeler tunes per se, but fit in well enough here.

  "text":"Contains Spoilers<br \/><br \/>A manipulative twerp named Cliff (Martin Donovan) and his beautiful wife Abbey (Julia Anderson) have a massive car accident which leaves the wife severely burned from head to toe and in a coma. Cliff, with the advice of his conniving lawyer Ira (Corbin Bornsen), decides he would like to pull the plug on her and set in motion a law suit that will result in millions of dollars be given to her beneficiary. The victim's mother is adamant that her daughter be kept alive and sets up petitions. What develops is a tale of vengeance as the victimized woman's ghost leaves her body whenever she \"flat lines\", and takes revenge on those who have scorned her. Her spirit is transported back in to her body once she is artificially resuscitated and waits to seek revenge once again the minute her heart stops beating.<br \/><br \/>Directed by Rob Schmidt (\"Wrong Turn\"), \"Right to Die\" has got to be one of the most stomach churning episodes I have seen to date (I have yet to finish watching all of Season 2). The gore is excruciatingly explicit and the subject matter disturbing. The body count is not as high as one might expect but there is enough blood and burnt flesh on display to keep those gore-hounds in check and those not expecting such graphic scenes of human suffering, will be pleasantly surprised. The main reasons this episode got to me was because it displays two aspects of human anguish that really irk me. The director did not shy away from exploiting these scenes of torment and showcases them in all of their gory glory in gooey explicit detail. The make-up effects are well done as is the gore effects and the performances are up to standard particularly Donovan. Those who are expecting a sub standard entry from this particular director (since he hasn't really made a horror film worthy of praise although I did enjoy \"Wrong Turn\") may be surprised as this entry far exceeds many others in the series in sheer entertainment and ferocity. Even those directed by more respected genre directors come up short in comparison. \"Right to Die\" definitely requires you to suspend disbelief, even the scenes that do not involve the resentful ghost wreaking havoc amongst the living but this is a horror tale so suspend your disbelief already and just sit back and enjoy the scenery as sick and perverse as the scenery is. Yuck and totally recommended.",

  "text":"A wonderful 3rd person tactical turn-based RTS shooter that was - and still is - grossly underrated although it has a small but devoted fanbase. The followings are my general impression of the game:<br \/><br \/>WHAT THE GAME DOES NOT DO SO WELL:<br \/><br \/>- Designed to Grind: This is, by far, my strongest criticism. If you stick to the main campaign, eventually, you will encounter an enemy elite trooper, and you will realize that you are hitting a stone wall - both figuratively and literally. At this time, the only course of action in order to move forward is to turn to the skirmish battles to grind ... and grind some more... to get the XP to train your troops and to upgrade their equipments and weapons to meet new challenge. Granted, this is generally the normal situation for virtually any game, but the difficulty level here just spike up too steep and too fast. What this game needs are either more campaigns or more skirmish maps (so you don have to play the same ones over and over) - preferably both - to balance the difficulty surge.<br \/><br \/>- Time Flies ... In good and bad way. Sure, time flies when you are having fun. However, without the ability to save game in the middle of a campaign, time turns into dead flies should you need to break from the game for an important task. Yes, I realize that not having manual save can make the game more challenging and perhaps even more tactical as intended by the developer, but for an adult with a full time job with long commute and limited game time, it's always a drawback.<br \/><br \/>WHAT THE GAME DOES REALLY WELL:<br \/><br \/>- Cel Shade in Spade: Admittedly, this is a personal preference, but I just love cel shaded graphics. For those who are not familiar, cel-shaded graphics look like a water color painting, with the Borderlands series being the most recognizable examples. Furthermore, beside the personal aesthetics appeal, being a relatively low level graphics requirement, cel shaded graphics compels the developer to scale back focus on photographic eye-popping candy vision and to concentrate on graphic design\/details, story development, and the gameplay instead. In addition, the cel-shaded graphics perfectly matches the story book style presentation of the game.<br \/><br \/>- Ace of Turn-Base: This is turn base done right and done extremely well; that is, the most common - and accurate - criticism of turn-based combat is that 'the enemies - or you - just stand there while being attacked...Well, not so in this game. With the exception of the sniper or lancer (anti-tank and heavy weapon specialist) classes, running around aimlessly within the enemies' firing range is simply a very bad idea -- You really have to plan your approach and engagement. Likewise, placing your own troops in strategic location will repel oncoming enemy charges even when it is not your turn to move.<br \/><br \/>-Story and History: It's not really much more than a re-imagination, or an alternate history, of World War 2 (IE. what if Nazi Germany had attacked a neutral Switzerland) with some ancient mythology thrown in for good measure; however, it is very well told in a comic book format where each panel unfolds into either a campaign or a cut scene that propels the story forward . But more than that, it's a compelling story of young men and women finding themselves involved in a cataclysmic event where youthful exuberance and aspiration are tempered by harsh wartime realities.<br \/><br \/>- Characters Development and Interaction: In conjunction with the story as it unfolds, over the course of time, you grow to care for the main characters and all of the supporting characters. In addition, as a CO (Commanding Officer) in charge of the platoon, you'll get the chance to play a subtle but complex mini-game of putting together the best possible fighting unit while taking into account each individual's strengths and weaknesses - and there are many of those to deal with.<br \/><br \/>In conclusion, I may have seemed harsh on my criticism of the game, but that is mainly due to the fact that I am a long time and hard core gamer on many gaming platforms and like to over-analyze video game (thank you for reading, BTW) rather than the game's shortcoming.  As is, my only lament is that there are not enough RTS games like Valkyria Chronicles these days - especially on consoles.",

Putting it on where the oxygen line, (usually green), meets the cannula, (usually clear), was so simple...just remove the coupling item & replace it with this. Now, after having it in place & using it I have 2 things to note. 1) it's so noisey clanging into things & across tile flooring, that I found it so helpfull to cut 2 pieces of gorilla mounting tape to fit the outer rims of the 2 end caps, & removing the plastic from ONLY 1 side of it, simply stick a piece securely to each flat edge of both end caps. It works like a cushion to dampen the noise & still having the plastic on the outside, it glides all over easily.  2)I noticed a drastic reduction in the amount of water in the line...BUT to my surprise, there was still a little build up of water drops in the clear cannula line!?

  "text":"Just because I believe Utopia is probably the worst of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas does not mean that I do not like it.  I love it!  It just isn't as great as, say, Ruddigore or Patience.  \"Bold fac'd ranger\" is among the greatest contralto songs of the canon.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this recording is adequate, the sound being only so-so.  While better than The Zoo's recorded quality, it doesn't come up to the standard of the 1960 sets.  It is too bright and lacks atmosphere.<br \/><br \/>John Reed and John Alydon make a fine pair of villains as Scaphio and Phantis respectfully, even if Reed has a tendency to be more abrasive than usual.  The singing of the Flowers of Progress is variable.  Most do well enough, even if Colin Wright and James Conroy-Ward have odd voices.<br \/><br \/>Lyndsie Holland has an uncomfortable higher range.  I don't know if this is because of the recording or what, but it somewhat mars her duets with Kenneth Sandford as Paramount.  Sandford, though definitely past his prime, still acquits himself well as King Paramount.  \"Society has quite forsaken\" is very successful, even if Sandford doesn't always seem comfortable with his E's.<br \/><br \/>Pamela Field as Zara is excellent, matched well by Meston Reid as Captain Fitzbattleaxe.  The former is one of the few D'Oyly Carte sopranos whose voice resembled Valerie Masterson, the latter one of the most interesting D'Oyly Carte tenors to appear on record.  The balance tends to favor him for some inexplicable reason: this would be unforgivable except that he sings Fitzbattleaxe very well.<br \/><br \/>All is not well in \"Eagle high.\"  The balance of the recording is messed up or something.  The acoustics seem cramped and stuffy.<br \/><br \/>That said, the Act I Finale goes admirably and overall, this recording can be recommended with at least some enthusiasm, as it presents one of Gilbert and Sullivan's rarest operas in a more or less complete form.  (We receive the shorter form of \"Ah, gallant soldier brave and true,\" no great loss.)  This recording contains no dialogue except for two 17 second clips in Act II and the complete dialogue preceding the finale.<br \/><br \/>The three fillers are enjoyable orchestral works by Sullivan.  The Macbeth Overture, the most interesting of the three, is perhaps too jovial for the program material but still finely crafted.  This is a worthy addition to any Gilbert and Sullivan collection!",

  "text":"Tracked this cd down for the Prince cover (one of my favorite Prince tracks) and also a big LC fan-- so-- double score.  The cover turned out to be simply: okay-- a pretty straight read, but the rest of the disc totally made up for it!  The first 10 tracks or so are live, 1993 Stain-era tour, from two different shows: Paris and Chicago.  These live tracks are totally visceral and nuanced, but, it is my guess that they have been given a few effect-heavy overdubs-- so, for you elitist \"live album\" people out there... that might be an issue, but the additions are really cool and give an alt-take feel to the album versions you would already know.  Then there are 4 acoustic version tracks, from a Dutch radio broadcast.  Simply beautiful, totally groovin' and show these songs to be very strong tunes without all of the electric beef that sometimes prop up the work of lesser material (not that they needed any validation, but somehow, the \"naked, acoustic\" thing goes a long way in many people's minds to really reveal of song's actual merit-- an observation).  After the 4 acoustics (which concludes with a piano and vocal arrangement of Will Calhoun's great \"Nothingness\" song) you get the Stain-era b-sides: \"17 Days\" and \"TV News.\"  TV is a cool track and would've fit nicely into Stain, but falls more in the \"vibe\" category than \"tune\" category.  Would've given Stain a nice widescreen track to compliment the rather boxy, claustrophobic assault of the rest of the album (although, I guess the original \"Nothingness\" pretty much did that).  Anyway, if you like LC and hard-ass, passionate, frenetic rock-- then it's a total must comp.  ...(their live work is always excellent, check out the more recent dvd, also...  they work off the studio sculptures and rebuild in exciting ways while not annoying the casual types by straying too far from the source...  but i would love to see them deconstruct and mutate their stuff...  very capable musicians...)",

Add to that mix a basement full of crazy science experiments Bella's mother has set aside unfinished, and there is definitely trouble brewing. Bella knows her mother had been talking about a time machine, but she hadn't finished it. That's okay, though. Bella is convinced that she and Joe are smart enough to finish it so they can use it. They even did a test run, using the time machine ray gun on Bella's sister's hamster - without telling her sister Becky, of course. And it seemed to work. Honey the hamster disappeared for a bit, then reappeared. Success! So, of course the next logical step is to use it on themselves. And that is when Bella discovers that the time machine ray gun is NOT actually a time machine ray gun; it's a shrink ray. And she has just shrunk her best friend! But don't worry! Bella has a plan!<br \/><br \/>I would be lying if I said this book didn't bring up memories of the movie Honey, I Shrunk the Kids! There were enough similarities: a science-oriented parent who is a bit scatterbrained? Check. A kid and friend who end up shrunk? Check. Crazy hijinks trying to get back to normal size while also avoiding craziness? Check. Ants? Check.<br \/><br \/>But even with the similarities, there are enough differences for this story to be its own, and it is a funny story. Bella is very confident - some might say over-confident - that she can solve the problem and get her and Joe back to normal size again. While Joe acts somewhat as a voice of reason, he's still in middle school, and thus not always logical or reasonable. So it should come as no surprise that Bella's plans to return them to full-size face difficulties, but it's the difficulties that make the story fun.<br \/><br \/>As this is the first book in a trilogy, we are left on a bit of a cliffhanger.

I have seen the evolution of this mag since the first issue and so glad they got rid of the gossip section. My favorite part is the DIY clothing transformation. The spreads have also been super saturated lately. The size is super cute and handy.<br \/><br \/>cons: no one would wear this stuff. The ads and the strange combinations of clothing articles contrast greatly. They make those poor girls wear the strangest things. I suspect some of the pairings are completely random and last minute. The writing is very simple. The articles are a rehash of teen issues that have been going on for decades. Vogue articles, on the other hand, are delicious to read.<br \/><br \/>I am 22 and I feel like I had outgrown the magazine. I am not sure which magazine to move on to, if at all. It was a cheap fun surprise each month while it lasted.",

  "text":"Cheerfully written and well organized, this book provides solid practical information for both entering the blogosphere to enhancing and highlighting business and personal blogs.  The first three chapters provide basic information.  Experienced bloggers probably could skip them and proceed to the more advanced chapters  Beginners will find a blueprint for basic blogging without being overwhelmed.  While very experienced, the author does not condescend.  Professional bloggers may find ways to supercharge their blogs without being bored or slowed down by the basics.<br \/><br \/>I liked this book.  The author has humor and her explanactions are concise.  She does not assume you are an idiot but does factor in that you may be a total novice. I found the book fun to read and easy to follow and am implementing many of her suggestions. If you know nothing about blogging you will easily understand it here.  If youare a beginner, this is the perfect primer. Even if you are super experienced,you will get a giggle out of some of her anecdotes and maybe even a bit of inspiration.",

She was brave, resourceful, and willing to work extremely hard.  I usually don't object to the prejudices expressed by 19th century authors regarding people different from them, for like most people, they are the product of their time and place. However, her chapter on Virginia City's Chinatown and the Chinese was breathtakingly vitriolic. No matter -- I was spellbound at the author's experiences.<br \/><br \/>Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer Ron James: (28 January 2009) commented, \" Mary McNair Mathews. Ten Years in Nevada is interesting as a primary source, although I always emerge from her journal-like book really disliking her.\"  As a woman, I tended to see her somewhat differently.  It is true that she was confident to the point of intolerance, and I have a hard time imagining her to be particularly likable, but I suspect Mr. James' negative point of view has something to do with the widespread dislike of \"uppity women.\"",

The belt clip works well but try not to be too heavy handed on the phone release latch. It doesn't seem as sturdy as others I've had but it's sturdy enough if you don't crank on it.

At least, not the author I know from other novels. I love everything else he has written independently. I detest the Mongoliad. But in and of itself, this is NOT a bad sci-fi novel. It's actually quite good. But it lacks all the other elements that make Stephenson one of the best writers of offbeat fiction. There is none of the usual humor, dramatic silliness, or insightful quirkiness that defines his previous works. Including Reamde, which more than any of his previous works possessed a dark and serious overtone, yet still captured the best elements of his talent.<br \/>I write the review without finishing the book because I already have encountered the points that negative reviewers object to. They are stylistic disagreements, as well as disappointments that are retrospectively created. Plot, climax, and conclusion have no arguments. It's just that this lacks everything that makes, or has made, Neil Stephenson one of the best writers of our time. Nonetheless, it is not bad. Quite good actually, and intriguing.<br \/>I'll write an actual review when I finish. This is just &#34;silence&#34; to haters.",

I tried some the best ranking amazon products but none of them worked for me. I ordered these because after my experience with some of the silicone metatarsal pads I ordered on amazon, they felt great on my feet taking away almost 60% of my pain. So I knew that silicone will be much comfortable and cushiony than gel.<br \/><br \/>The only reason I'm giving a 4 star rating for this product is because A.) I really wish they were long enough to cover the toes because in order to use these, you have to remove the old insoles from your shoes. These are not long enough to cover the toes so when you wear your shoes with these insoles, your toes are not on the same level as the rest of your foot, they drop a bit so it does cause pain in the toes which is weird but it's true. (I actually cut my old insoles around the toe area and placed that in the shoe before putting these in.)<br \/><br \/>B.) My second reason is that, although these are wonderful insoles, great for work but I wish they came without the arch. I don't have flat feet, but I also don't have high arch and these would be perfect for someone with high arch feet. For me, they start to hurt after some time..I have normal feet with normal arch and I really don't need arch support in my insole.<br \/><br \/>Overall, it's a good product..it can be great if they consider the two suggestions I wrote up there (long enough to cover the toes and no arch support).",

And luckily, copies of this often CAN be found at a decent price.<br \/><br \/>The 6 tracks from the &#34;best of&#34; portion of the programming, ranging from 1977 - 1987, are: Me & the Boys, Ridin' in my Car, Rain at the Drive-In, I Want You Bad, Crazy Like a Fox, and Green Lights. These truly do represent some of NRBQ's best work. And the Wild Weekend material includes the absolute gem Little Floater, as well as solid tracks like Boy's Life and If I Don't Have You.<br \/><br \/>So it's a solid collection of material, and while it's obviously tilted towards one album that was pretty good but not one of NRBQ's best, and thus is a weak substitute as a best of collection for &#34;Peek-A-Boo&#34;, the lower price may make it a good option from a beginner looking to discover this fine band.",

  "text":"This volume is a little mis-named by DC and is probably why there's a perception by some that the \"Thy Kingdom Come\" storyline drags on too long. The truth is that, although the \"Kingdom Come Superman\" does manage to show up in this volume, the actual TKC storyline doesn't really get going until volume 2. Others have covered the plots of the volume so I won't repeat it, but I think it might have been a smarter, and more accurate move on DC's part, to have called this volume \"Strange Visitor\" rather than TKC part 1.<br \/><br \/>Nevertheless, it's a beautiful volume full of dense, and complex stories with multiple characters. Johns' strength as a writer is that he makes characters distinct with just a few lines of dialogue. Due to the large cast, few characters get lots of face time but Johns manages to make each one distinct and likeable at the same time. The characters interactions can be whimsical, like Superman's interaction with Starman at a sanitariam, funny, painful, such as Superman's interaction with Power Girl, inspiring or intense, such as when the villain Gog confronts the JSA. Johns is also a master at complex, multilayered plotting, and events unfold over multiple issues that plant seeds for future issues, but have pay-offs all their own. In that way, Johns bucks the trend of modern comic storytelling, particularly the type at Marvel in recent years, where stories never have pay-offs in the actual pages or series where they begin.<br \/><br \/>There's a tendency by critics to knock the fill-in artist just because the fill-in is the fill-in. Fernando Pasarin does an excellent job pencilling in his issues here, as does Dale Eaglesham. Eaglesham in paticular has become quite adept at handling scenes with mutiple characters all in one panel. He appears to do it effortlessly, though in a very few strange instances, his pencilling fluctuates between tight realism and exaggerated expressionism. Thankfully, this is far and away the exception rather than the rule.<br \/><br \/>Both he and Pasarin though make an almost too successful attempt at differentiating between the KC Superman and the one from \"this\" world. Beside the obvious differences in the darker blue costume of the KC Superman and the different S shield, our Superman is younger, more ripped, leaner, and more chiselled in the face, but in some cases a very different looking fellow, which I think is odd. From Alex Ross' notes I can see that this was intentional and the differences, facially, are meant to be a few and subtle, but part of what makes this story compelling is that the events happening here should ideally be an indication of a possible future for our Superman. Having the characters look too different, actually just underscores that what happens in KC won't occur on this world, because they really are two different universes. I've always thought it was a good idea at least to tease the possibility that the KC future was a possible future for this Superman, and that the KC Superman was really just an older, more battle weary version of the current Man of Steel. The differences between the two characters are sometimes so strong as to undermine that. To be clear, I think both Ross and Johns intend to strongly imply that the events of the KC world could be the future of our Superman's world, but I wish they hadn't made the characters too distict in some places.<br \/><br \/>All in all though, this is a minor distraction. As the second collection from this relaunched Justice Society of America, it's a satisfying collection of strong stories, showcasing Geoff Johns skill at characterization and why the reborn DC universe is a more interesting place, now that parallel worlds are back on the menu for creative people working there. If you're a JSA or a Kingdom Come fan, it's a must own, and if you're looking for just a great epic read, you should buy this.",

  "text":"First off, Schoolly was to me what Elvis must have been to my parents. He's like an old best friend who might have gotten drunk a few times and said some things he didn't mean, but ya gotta love him (I'm referring to his occasional wack record). So, sad that my favorite albums of his were unavailable, I shelled out the scratch for this uneven collection. I was immediately dissapointed that \"Put Your Filas On\" was not the original mix. It's as if someone thought all the goofy vocal effects on the original mix weren't nineties enough. And they included some of his weaker tunes in place of cold house-rockers like \"We Get Ill\", \"Housin' The Joint\", and even \"Signifyin' Rapper\" and \"P-ssy Ain't Nothin'\". BUT! There's some great stuff on here! \"Gucci Time\" where he repeats the chorus until it becomes a mantra, over frenetically funky ride cymbals. \"Oh man that's what they is...\" And of course the song that gave birth to \"6 in the Mornin'\" by Ice-T and \"Boyz-n-tha-Hood\" by Eazy-E, the seminal \"P.S.K. (What Does It Mean?)\". I'd like to add that while many people recognize Schoolly as the pioneer of gangsta rap, few if any realize that he also started the hybrid of rock and rap. Yes, Run-DMC did their thing with Aerosmith, but in 1988 I saw Schoolly on tour warming up for Fishbone with a rock band backing him (for a full set-- not just one song). It wasn't until P.E. teamed up with Anthrax that it really caught on, but, all along there was Schoolly, again a pioneer. He's infamous for making fun of rock'n'roll, so there's plenty of irony to be had there. I recommend this CD to anyone who's interested in the poor forgotten rapper whom everyone you listen to bit their styles from. Pop it in your player, kick back, and \"Smoke Some Kill\".",

I have a 28&#34; that I bought knowing it was a prototype and the markings on the front are horizontal rather than the usual sun burst pattern that Meinl uses.  It has nice low end when played softly, but climbs up into high harmonics very quickly.  It was my second gong and works well with my first, a 32&#34; Paiste Symphonic.  I was surprised when I got this 24&#34; Wu Xing and it has the same pattern.  Again, centered low end at a very soft volume, but really A LOT of harmonics as the volume increases.  It took some getting used to, but I do like it and it works well paired with the 28&#34; for quiet events where I want easy transport and set up.  Interestingly it is my wife's favorite of the five gongs I currently own.  I say 'currently' because they seem to be like tattoos.

It would be nice for Amazon to send out a message a day or two prior to shipping with the item description so that you can either pass on that month or select a back up item. I prefer the &#34;back-up item&#34; option because it would help avoid repeats as well.

Sure, you can sit in the chopper on your in game phone and listen to tapes for hours to get filled in. But I'm here to PLAY a game. I would much rather have the MGS style movie-like cut scenes.

  "text":"I like many others have waited for 8 long years with baited breath for the next Metallica installment, being a long time fan. I have listened to Death Magnetic, which I really enjoy for the most part, many times in that time, poor production aside.<br \/>When I first heard the &#34;Hardwired&#34; single, I was impressed. Heavy with echoes of &#34;My Apocalypse&#34; and even &#34;Damage Inc.&#34; from<br \/>Master Of Puppets came to mind. Then &#34;Moth Into Flame&#34; came, which also instantly grabbed my interest and finally &#34;Atlas,Rise&#34; which I also loved. I was pumped and positive that this album was looking good. I got and advance copy a couple of days ago and listened to the whole album in my Seinheiser headphones in one sitting.<br \/>The first disc totally blew me away. Solid in all areas and as good as anything Metallica has released in my opinion. Heavy and signature Metallica, but yet also exploring new ground which Metallica are not afraid to do which though hasn't worked for me all the time (Reload), this time it did. The track order in particular on fisc one is just heavy hit after heavy hit. The tracks formentioned as well as &#34;Dream No More&#34;, &#34;Halo On Fire&#34; and the Danzig era of The Misfits reminscent &#34;Now That We're Dead&#34; are all dark and heavy like early days Metallica. After disc 1 I was curious to know how the momentum could keep going or they coukd top such an intense and interesting ride.<br \/>Disc 2 opens havy again with &#34;Confusion&#34; which I grabbed my attention as did the following &#34;ManUNkind&#34; and &#34;Here Comes Revenge&#34;. Progressive and heavy still I was still very much getting into this album. In saying that all these songs are long, and in a row are a bit too much but still not bad songs.<br \/>Then comes &#34;Am I Savage&#34;, very much like &#34;Of Wolf and Man&#34; from the Black album which I don't like and think is cheesey and this song I must say was a speed hump for me. Following this is &#34;Murder One&#34; which although is a thoughtful dedication to the great Lemmy from Motorhead, is a rather week song and does make a detour the album feels to loose focus and impact more so. Its not a particularly interesting or engaging track. Then, comes &#34;Spit Out The Bone&#34; which is back on target. A final heavy jolt that re-engaged me and was a great end to a mostly great album.<br \/>In this album you'll hear just about every eraxof Metallica that's been, and some more interesting new directions. My only criticism is the two tracks I mentioned which aren't terrible, and that the second disc could of had some of the tracks shortened to add more effect and not slow the album down a bit as they are a bit unecessarily long and some what unfocused.<br \/>This is for the most part a welcome return for Metallica, and I will say that I will listen to this album as much as I do most of the other albums on heavy rotation. Oh and production is ok on this album, but still looks like dynamic compression has played a part unfortunately!<br \/>Can't wait to hear some of these songs live!<br \/>Worth the 8 year wait and Metallica show that they still have it and are not afraid to break new ground and take which is one of the reasons why I love this band!

  "text":"I've been reading all of the fan reviews on \"Awake\" and they remind me of when Josh Groban released his second studio CD, \"Closer\".  People initially complained that it was too different from his debut CD, but most eventually came to appreciate the album on its own merit.  It seems this particular artist is caught trying to satisfy his own eclectic artistic needs while juggling the wants of the fans who are \"die-hards\" for the \"sweeping, powerful classical\" ballads, most of which are sung in Italian, and his newer base of fans who are embracing the softer, more breezy music sung in English.  When I first listened to the CD, I was concerned for its success only because I assumed people would jump the gun in their assessment of it -- dismissing it based on his prior releases rather than appreciating it on its own.  I have to say that with each listen this CD takes more hold of me. My favorite offering on the 13 track album is by far \"February Song\", with \"Mia\", \"Un Dia LLgara\", \"In Her Eyes\" and the strange, funkiness of \"Machine\" following.  The Tower of Power horns on \"Machine\" are infectious.  Gorban does not always have to sing sweeping classically influenced power ballads for one to appreciate his beautiful voice.  It's in fine form here irreguardless of what he is singing.  There is a bit of everything on \"Awake\" for all of his fanbase.  My only criticsim of this album is that the title song, \"Awake\", the strongest of the tracks on all three versions of the CD, is not on the main album -- and I must say I believe \"You Are Loved\" was a mistake to release as the \"Flagship\" or debut single for the first CD he has released in three years.  While the lyrics on paper are beautiful, they sound as if they were \"forced\" into the generic, pedestrian melody.  I believe it is the weakest track on the album and he would have been better served releasing \"February Song\" as the first single.  Despite, \"Awake\" is a good listen and I applaud Josh Groban for diversifying.",

This is the only brand that CONSISTENTLY works! And It works 98% of the time. It is also quick. However, it only gets 4 starts as it was a pain to install. I have installed MANY of these protectors over the years. This one is bad with the bubbles! It takes a long time to squeeze out all the bubbles and push down on the glass so the bubbles don't come back. However, It is worth it.",

The photos associated with this listing (as of this writing) show a curved rotating belt clip with its own 'kickstand' feature; however the unit I received has a different belt clip without the kickstand, and it isn't curved at all. The belt clip also will likely not stand up to daily use.<br \/><br \/>The material used for the case itself is rather thin, but that keeps the case light and compact. I would not consider this to be anything other than a light-duty case, despite its appearance...and don't trust the case to protect the phone in a fall of any significant height. In fact, I would suggest keeping the holster on the phone at all times as the phone is vulnerable without it. The case is also flexible due to the design and material used. Thus it will bend, allowing your phone to bend too if it is hooked onto your belt in the front when you bend over.<br \/><br \/>If you're looking for a case to protect your phone from scratches and very minor stresses and falls (assuming you keep the holster on), then this case is a good value. The workmanship is excellent and it fits the iPhone 6 (4.7&#34;) perfectly.<br \/><br \/>TWO YEAR UPDATE (October 26, 2017):<br \/><br \/>Despite my initial impression, this phone case has exceeded my expectations for the protection of my device. After more than TWO years of continual daily use and abuse, the case has held up exceptionally well and saved my phone many times from breakage. I will definitely buy another one when my next phone requires a different case, but for now this tough product is working well to protect my phone and is an exceptional value.<br \/><br \/>The only caveat is with the permanence of the red color.

His drumming is always well done, and his instantly identifiable tenor tends to leap out to grab you at key moments -- \"Against All Odds\" was melodramatic balladeering of the highest order; \"A Groovy Kind of Love\" is a mellow but touching remake; \"Another Day in Paradise\" features killer backing vocals by David Crosby and an immediately affecting keyboard line; \"In the Air Tonight\" is apocalyptic and powerful; and \"Separate Lives\" (written by Stephen Bishop) delivers a biting confrontational lyric using . And unlike so many other pop performers, Collins often succeeds in giving some edge to his music -- the drums that burst forth onto \"In the Air Tonight\" and \"Another Day in Paradise\"; the throbbing strings on \"Against All Odds\" (courtesy of Arif Mardin), soaring vocals on \"Separate Lives\" (with help from duet partner Marilyn Martin) -- his background drumming for Genesis and Robert Plant may have given him the valuable knowledge that fluff without some kind of needling in its midst tends to float and then dissipate.<br \/>Many a sneering musician today, who would scoff at the thought of listening to \"Phil Collins\", could learn a thing or two from this sly, crafty songwriter.

Although operating mostly on the Christian side of the hard rock line, nobody could ever deny this guy had the guitar\/songwrighting skills to kick some major butt in the secular world.<br \/><br \/>This collection is alot to take in with only a couple listens. Being twenty songs, this album does take some time to get the whole way through. However, after a few listens, you can easily understand why this guy is so well respected in the game. The overall sound of the album is quite similar to his previous work in Shout, although not as guitar driven on his solo records. The songs on these releases are most definitely pop-metal, with some sugar-coated pop music thrown in for good measure. I couldn't find a song I didn't like, However, these were the highlights for me, \"Livin' For My Lord\", \"Going All The Way\", \"Media Mania\", \"Stand Up\", \"Stand By My Side\" and \" Come And Save Me\".<br \/><br \/>If you like Ken Tamplin, or anything related to Christian Rock of the late 80's\/early 90's, you owe it to yourself to check these records out.

  "text":"After thinking about backpack\/camp cooking for many years, last year, I finally settled on a set of six seasonings for my standard kit (exclusive of salt and sugar): onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, msg (yes, msg), citric acid, and ginger. I first started out with the small size spices from the supermarket, which are about 2 fl oz each. As it turns out, they weigh quite a lot when filled.<br \/><br \/>So, I decided to reserve that set for group camping, and for my next version, I ordered a bunch of Nalgene 30 mL (~1 fl oz) wide mouth HDPE bottles. That was a big improvement, but I realised very quickly that I didn\u2019t actually need to carry that much seasoning for shorter trips. So, when I realised the GSI set is made up of three 0.5 fl oz compartments and three 0.3 fl oz compartments, I figured that would be a good size for weekend trips.<br \/><br \/>I use the smaller sides for the msg, cayenne, and citric acid, since those are used in much smaller quantities, and the larger sides for the onion, garlic, and ginger. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to order a second set, even, for two reasons. First, that one black cap bugs me; with a second set, I can either have all white caps, or have one unit with two black caps. Second, a fourth container would allow me to bring two savory spices, for which I will probably bring cinnamon and cardamom, opening up a wider range of flavors I can cook with on the trail. That will leave me with two extra containers for spares, in case I lose one, or in case I want to swap out the fourth for a different set of spices\/herbs.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m Asian, and I love to mix all eight of my standard seasonings for a campfire stir-fry: salt, sugar, msg, onion, garlic, ginger, citric acid, and cayenne. Adding cinnamon and cardamom allows me to reach into more South and Southeast Asian flavors, as well.<br \/><br \/>The GSI containers are heavier than the Nalgene 30mL bottles, but the size is better for a solo camper, and the volume savings makes it worth the trouble. I could just fill the Nalgene bottles only halfway, but they would still take up the same volume in my pack.<br \/><br \/>Update: After removing the inner shaker caps and silly rubber bandolier, the three bottles together weigh 87 g. Six of the Nalgene 30 mL HDPE wide mouth round bottles weigh 68 g. So, the GSI bottles are substantially heavier, because they hold only about half as much inside, the overall weight will end up being substantially lower in my pack, and the smaller amounts will still be plenty for a 3-day weekend trip, and possibly longer, for a solo backpacker\/camper.",

Booth--This is really good stuff because Maxwell underplays one of the most identifiable villians in American history.Maxwell reimagines Booth as a somewhat efeminant,insignificant character,who,at this point,doesn't have a story or a purpose,because we already know him and his oncoming crime against the country.Chris Conner does a really good job as Booth.Maxwell does not let the Booth character radiate evil,as you would expect,Booth does not seem special from a legendary standpoint.His good looks draws women,groupie like.He is considered a good actor from a great family of actors.Maxwell uses Booth as a backdrop to the giant story at hand.He is ominous because we know we have not seen the last of him.<br \/>3)The way the film is divided into 5 parts,gives you a sense of where you are in the grand scheme of things to come.<br \/>4)The preaching is held to a minimum<br \/>5)The beautiful little added  scene,which introduces us to a new,historical,essetial character,<br \/> Jackson's horse  \"Little Sorrell\"<br \/>6)In the extended version I sensed an integrity,a diligence to detail,which lends itself to the intensity of watching the film.<br \/>7)GG Ext. Version is a great,long,flawed movie,throw out the theatrical version,This is about as good as GG can be....<br \/>8)It is too bad the 3rd part of the trilogy was scrapped.I have a feeling Maxwell was in the process of bringing all the loose ends together so as to make his epic trilogy as one,as he maintains the end of the civil war was symbolized not by a surrender at Appomattox but by the Union bullet that struck J.W. Booth in the throat killing him,as he hid in a barn in Virginia.It was the largest manhunt in US history.It is too bad for us that Maxwell could not fimish his cinematic vision of the Civil War.The concluding movie would have probably made us aware of the greatness of the whole project relative to the first and second parts,and the unmade third part.",

  "text":"Well any thoughts I've ever had about Rage being certifiable, has now been confirmed. This girl is one bad ass cray cray, and I sure as hell don't want to get on her wrong side because I actually like all my body parts intact thank you very much. Ms.Frazier delivered one hell of a strong,feisty, take no bull, she would burn ALL your shhh, female character that you will never forget. Just know this: They don't call her &#34;Rage&#34; for nothing.<br \/><br \/>After being introduced to her in &#34;Soulless, I've been patiently waiting for Rage's story. There was something so different about her and the way she handled herself that made me take immediate notice of her character. She was a category eight hurricane and I knew that her past and present were filled with nothing but utter destruction and I couldn't wait to uncover what kind of torment she left behind.<br \/><br \/>After being away from her family for the past three years, Rage has developed quite the reputation of being one of the most feared people in her line of work. She's takes pride in her job and she loves what she does so when her friend asks her for a favor,she reluctantly agrees. What she didn't plan on was getting too close to her target and Nolan Archer became THE very definition of close.<br \/><br \/>&#34;You'll learn that when it comes to you, I'm going to do what I want to, and more than that, ....&#34;You're gonna love what I want to do to you&#34;.<br \/><br \/>Nolan hasn't had it easy for the past couple of months. He has been in a constant state of &#34;DONT GIVE A DAMN and everything that he thought was messed up, is going to pale in comparison when he meets the infamous Rage. But attraction is a B* and passion? That's one of the deadly things and when you mix that in with Forbiddenness? It all goes BOOM. Those two we're like fireworks when they got together and I feared for every object that surrounded them. They were HAWT!!<br \/><br \/>I LOVED that this story was different from the previous books but at the same time, it had the same depth as the others. Nolan was such a lovable character and he really held his own in this one and I also liked that he never tried to change Rage. He accepted her all her craziness and he became something she never knew she wanted which was a partner, a lover and a friend.

Cook\u2019s story is set in 1974, after all.<br \/><br \/>However, the scope quickly expands as the death count mounts.<br \/><br \/>Based on isolated actual events, OMW tracks the proto-investigation of murders dating back 50 years, as stumbled upon by newly-minted detective Penelope \u201cPenny\u201d Bryce. If this sounds similar to Thomas Harris\u2019 Silence of the Lambs, that is a healthy comparison. But where Harris takes the modern interstate to his destination, Cook takes the back alley.<br \/><br \/>Those who enjoy a good who-done-it but have a low gore point will love OMW. Cook writes against most established tropes. The Columbo analogy really does stand up in this regard. There is no graphic violence, no sexual violence, no misogyny and only passing reference to a murdered child.",

  "text":"I don't plan on writing a lengthy review, most reviewers have already touched on the hits and misses with this title. However, if you enjoy the movie series and want to play a FPS that's refreshing and different, give this game a spin.<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/>-All three species have their pros and cons, I believe the game is very balanced. It's just a matter of figuring out which species fits you best. Personally, i've had the best of luck with the Predator, but i'm improving playing as the Alien. The Predator is good for stealthy kills and the Alien is good for stealth and quick-strike attacks. However, the Marine has advantages too. If you see an Alien or Predator coming from a distance, it's very easy to score a kill on them.<br \/>-True and accurate of the franchise. The weapons and character models are spot on. The environment and sound effects are great as well. The Alien uses its tail and claws for attacking, the Predator has razor claws, a blaster cannon, and a throwing disc, the Marine has a variety of weapons including an automatic rifle, machine gun, and flame thrower.<br \/>-Multiplayer is a blast! Tons of different game modes and very challenging.<br \/>-I have enjoyed the campaign modes for the Alien and Predator thus far. The story is solid and the gameplay is fun and interesting. Playing through these campaigns is a good way to learn all three species before you enter online play.<br \/>-Survivor Mode is a fun addition. Basically you are a Marine and have to try to survive through wave after wave of Alien attacks.<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>-Graphics could have been better. The graphics for this 2010 game are slightly above average. I was expecting better, but it doesn't hurt the experience much.<br \/>-Game play needs tweaking. I appreciate the fact that trophy kills can be difficult and that there is a sense of strategy to the game. However, the melee attack system is somewhat flawed. It can prove really difficult to get accuracy out of a melee attack.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's not your typical boring shooter that you've played 100 times already. The different classes of species really offer variety\/balance and require a lot of strategy. The campaign modes are fun and really help you learn how to master each species for online play. If the game would have had better graphics and slight gameplay tweaks, it would have been an easy 5\/5.",

  "text":"The benefits of a regular smart watch include accurate time, handy notifications, and of course the ability to add new features with software instead of purchasing a new watch. This hybrid smartwatch is interesting because on the one hand it has a fixed mechanical face (it is NOT a digital display). Although digital displays are pretty nice, they still come on and off and consume battery constantly. That may be a negative for some people that want to change the look of their watch often.<br \/><br \/>Although the display is mechanical, this watch includes an activity tracker that tracks footsteps\/motion which syncs via Bluetooth. I'm not sure how important this is because if you carry your cell phone all day, it also includes an activity tracker. For me I do like that it is tracking my steps even when I don't have my cell phone such as when I place it in my vehicle and am loading\/unloading, on a call with Bluetooth headset (and phone is on the desk), etc.<br \/><br \/>The watch can be configured with the Skagen cell phone application (in my case I used\/tested with Android) to move the minute and second hand to any location when certain (configurable) notifications arrive. For example, I configured mine to move both hands to 12 position for message from my wife, 1pm for message from 1st kid, 2pm for second kid, etc. You can also configure it to give motion or sound\/vibrate notifications for things like emails, social media events, IFTT events, basically -- most events that can pop-up on your cell phone screen can be notifications that can be translated to a mechanical position, vibration, and sound. I used all position and vibration as I don't want the sound.<br \/><br \/>In fact the times I most like having a watch are the times when I would have my phone mutued and don't want a ringer such as at a meal time, at church, or in a meeting. For this the watch is extremely helpful. Likewise I like having it in the kitchen, where I much prefer not to have an expensive cell phone next to food and liquids.<br \/><br \/>The downsides are the weight and size. It is huge like a smartwatch. Not at all slim -- and heavy. I'm not used to wearing a watch except for special occasions, but I'm giving it a new try with this watch. I'm not convinced I'll stay with it because it is yet another task to add (put on \/ take off) and another item to clean and care for which I don't love.<br \/><br \/>But when I'm outdoors, walking, in the kitchen, in a meeting (f2f), or other places when I don't want a phone out, it is still helpful to have the time and the benefit of notices without having to open the phone. An added benefit is that I have my phone configured to stay unlocked when paired with the watch so I'm not unlocking my phone as often.",

On the Dimarzio site you can see the specs. This one is very close in sound to the Dimarzio Tone Zone too, but the reason for that could be that their specs are similar. When you use this pickup with a dirty setting it really shines. Clean is good but the treble is not there so much more mid range and bass. This pickup gets incredible pinch harmonics, even better than my Dimarzio Tone Zone Humbucker in my other guitar. I would highly recommend this pickup if you want to change your tele to a less traditional sound to a rock sound. Now I can play Van Halen, Boston and some metal with it. I do like the split middle position which still sounds very tele. As for a pickup to pair it with I chose the Area T which is highest output noiseless neck pickup Dimarzio has. It pairs well but you have to adjust each pickup for level of volume due to the fact the Super Distortion overpowers a bit. I would recommend this pickup. So clean and quiet.",

It is nice because you cannot see the fluid on the inside and the fluid gels together so if tipped over it won't spill. The only drawback for us was the sustainability of using this product. One bottle would only last my husband about 16-18 hours before it was full. So six bottles would equal six days. I will be keeping some on hand to use when we go on long trips etc. Its just not economic enough for daily use.",

I would say until chapter 10 it's pretty well paced after that it started to drop and has the same vibes of AKOFAF with not much happening tbh, just Poppy and Casteel going from one place to the next one and talking to people and then then the last 20% are INTENSE. I'm still stressed just thinking about everything that happened. **googles how to find your inner peace**<br \/><br \/>The fact that we have to wait a year until the next book comes out.. nothing screams masochist louder than reading fantasy series that are still on-going. \ud83d\udc80",

  "text":"This is a definitely a high fantasy book.<br \/><br \/>Although maybe its not for everyone, this book will be a success among the fantasy\/manga lovers.<br \/><br \/>The author, from whom I read for the very first time, created this universe where there are Gates between the spirit and human worlds. Every Gate has a Guardian, and every Guardian has a Keeper, from whom the Guardian gets his powers.<br \/><br \/>The Guardian is always a spirit and the Keeper is human. Until Kit, who is half spirit half human. Kit\u2019s father is the strongest spirit among the Guardians of the Gate who fell in love with Kit\u2019s human mother. Unfortunately, Kit\u2019s mom died, and soon after, his Gate appeared to Kit. Since then, Kit had several Keepers all\u2014Zane\u2019s ancestors.<br \/><br \/>Being a Guardian means him nor the Keeper can venture far from the Gate. So when Zane arrives, Kit is holding back telling the truth to Zane because Zane wants to travel the world.<br \/><br \/>Zane was uprooted from his old home and moved into the house his uncle left him and his twin sister. They grew up in foster care after their parents died. Until recently, they didn\u2019t know about their uncle.  Something is pulling him toward this house. He can\u2019t explain it, but this pull is accompanied by righteousness and a feeling of belonging. Imagine his surprise when he finds out that the house comes with a very handsome caretaker.<br \/><br \/>I love fantasy, the imagination of authors who are capable of creating such an imaginary world always amazes me.  I\u2019m probably not wrong when I say that in every man there is still a little guy who likes to imagine being a pirate or mage or warrior, some kind of superhero. This book awakened this child inside of me allowing me to travel in this world where magic is normal and other species are fascinating!<br \/><br \/>***The ARC was provided by Dreamspinner Press.

While they are not necessarily big features, they are nice - zippers to remove portions of the fabric covering as opposed to having to stretch and pull and yank; removable silicone cup holder inserts; shoulder straps with adjustable height that don't require removing the seat from the car.  Our 8 month old daughter seems to find it comfortable.  While she is not capable of enumerating her likes and dislikes about it, she makes her opinion known.<br \/><br \/>I think our favorite feature is the adjustable shoulder straps.  Most seats require you to remove them from the car and threat the straps out, and back in, to a new hole in the seat back.  This seat has what appears to be a tension positioner for the shoulder straps.  You can pull them up or down to adjust the height without having to remove the seat from the car.<br \/><br \/>This is not a compact seat.  So don't expect to cram this in to a small car that already has a seat next to it - I doubt it would fit.  We have it in our minivan and it fully occupies a second row captain chair.  We have not used the seat as an intermittent seat or booster yet, so I can't comment on how that conversion or installation goes.",

I have made numerous trips to the Disney resort, and have saved a great deal of time and money using his book \"The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\".<br \/>Much like his WDW book, this guide offers honest rankings of activities such as shows, attractions, and dining for parks including Busch Gardens, Cypress Gardens, Gatorland, Kennedy Space Center, Sea World, Universal Studios and Universal's Island of Adventure.  As a water park fan I appreciate the detailed comparison and ratings of the different water parks, including Disney's.  It also has a section discussing night life and dinner theaters, but doesn't cover or compare Downtown Disney or Cirque Du Solie.<br \/>While the brutally honest ratings are great in this book, I am greatly disappointed that their traffic gurus didn't write up touring plans for which their WDW are famous.  There is plenty of detailed information that will allow you to create \"battle plans\" based on age, type of ride, and attraction popularity.<br \/>It is a small book, easily carried in a fanny pack and is an excellent companion with their \"Mini Mickey\" book for touring, and \"The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" for planning.

They were matching numbers. So I ordered it. The shape is not exact but the area that it differs is not relevant. It is a plastic mold around a wire screen. The old lint trap used a softer mesh. The felt sides that keep the lint from passing around the filter are not as thick as the original one. I would have liked them to have stuck out a little more so, to prevent lint from getting past better, but all in all the filter works fine. I am holding on to the old one for awhile...just in case.<br \/><br \/>My 2 cents: If you have never taken your dryer part and vacuumed the inside of it (the parts that you don't see) you should. There are plenty of video out there that will show you how to take apart your dryer. The lint that get past the lint trap over the years accumulates on the motor and the bottom of the dryer. Huge fire hazard. If you are too nervous to take your dryer apart and put it back together have a professional do it. Also never leave your home with the dryer running. While you are at it...your exhaust fans in your bathroom and the coils on you fridge will thank you for a good vacuum as well.",

I noticed this on 3\/4 of my walls. I think why this is is because I made a glop of the stuff on certain sections and it doesn't dry fast like the GreenGlue so it will drip down to the floor as waste.

Protip: don't waste your gold on land. It's better to save up and pay for the land. The more buildings you have, the faster you can save up. The pop up is sudden so that can be kind of annoying if you are trying to lay a road down. I like that you can put walking paths or canals instead of or in addition to the regular streets. My city uses mostly canals which looks really cool.<br \/><br \/>I give it four stars because it takes too much time to level up to the get to the next building after 30.

  "text":"I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.<br \/><br \/>This 4-song EP is a great taste of An Endless Sporadic, and indeed of instrumental progressive rock in general (Sometimes progressive metal). The songs themselves are really good, although sometimes they seem a bit unstructured (but hey isn't that in the band's name?). The variation is cool though - this music can get really heavy, and then the next second go into a soft jazz breakdown, and then back to some odd-time-signature metal or something. These musicians are definitely very talented.<br \/><br \/>This EP misses out on a 5 star rating because, as I said, occasionally a song-section will seem misplaced or inappropriate; but that's something that fans of An Endless Sporadic would probably enjoy. And it doesn't happen often.<br \/>It also lost points because the recording itself doesn't seem to be of very high audio quality; I'm no audiophile but it was noticeable even through my basic speakers and headphones. However, considering the low budget the band was probably on, they definitely churned out a quality product.<br \/><br \/>I would recommend this CD. Come on, it's 5 dollars!",

These are, rather, one of these are just put in service recently and not in a full-time fashion. The voltage meets the specs. If the voltage is correct, the product using the battery will determine the current being drawn and that varies with its usage. The only other things I can comment on is the heat generated by the battery, and that is also determined by the drain on the battery. The life of the battery is dependent on a lot of things especially the drain of current. I will watch heat and life and if either or both are short compared to other brands I us I will edit this review. If you see nothing for the next 6 months, you will know I rate them a good value for the money.",

  "text":"I've got both styles...several G&C's in fact.  The Crossrock is the \"overall\" equal.  If some respects better, in some not.<br \/>The better:<br \/>The latches!  The two latches on Fender G&C cases, while vintage correct, are COMPLETE garbage.  Yes that's what they used years ago...on Fender cases, luggage, etc. and they are total garbage.  It's not \"if\" they're going to fail...it's WHEN.  That's why you never see these things used anymore except maybe...maybe on briefcases.  Every G&C case I own, I added latches on them, the same style on the Crossrock case.  They work...they don't fail because of a spring that costs literally 1\/1000th of a cent that's holding those G&C latches closed.<br \/>The seal.  The seal on the Crossrock isn't waterproof...neither is the G&C...but it's tighter on the Crossrock. Well the one I bought is.<br \/>The padding.  Slightly better than the G&C. The material for the interior lining seems to be the same, but there's more padding in the Crossrock.  The added removable long pad is a great touch.  If your guitar body moves around, it solves that problem.<br \/>The storage pocket is bigger that the G&C's and the placement provide additional and better neck support that the G&C doesn't have.<br \/><br \/>The worst or equal to the G&C:<br \/>The handle.  Neither case has a handle that is built to take abuse.  They work fine...provided you're not an accident prone klutz.<br \/>The layers of wood.  G&C wins.  The Crossrock isn't thinly layered...but the G&C has more.  This is one area that cuts the cost.<br \/>The trim. G&C again is the winner again.  This is another area that cuts cost.<br \/>The stitching on the trim.  G&C again.  Cuts cost.<br \/>Tolex\/Tweed covering.  G&C is again slightly thicker, not much but when you run your fingers along the cases you can tell the G&C is a little thicker. Cuts cost for Crossrock.<br \/><br \/>At the end of the day for transporting a guitar from point A to point B...in a car or short walks...I'd buy the Crossrock.<br \/>For a touring musician?  Neither...both will fail at some point.  Vintage style cases aren't used by touring musicians for this reason...they don't stand up to it.  This is why modern design cases exist.<br \/>For a flight?  NEITHER!  You'd have to be stupid.  Just smash the guitar before handing it over to an airliner and save the baggage $50 fee the airline is going to charge you for the joy they'll have in destroying it themselves.  If you have to check a guitarcase and it's a guitar you like or costs more than $100...spend the money on something designed to be used as a flightcase.",

  "text":"I can still remember hearing Cliffs of Dover on the radio in Falmouth, MA when my parents were taking my too Old Silver Beach.  To say that this song made a lasting impression on me is an understatement.  I was probably only 12 years old, born in 1978.  That song thus makes this album very special to me.<br \/>In fact, I actually probably didn't get it on cd until high school.  This should beg the question: Why 4 stars and not 5?  The answer is that, in my opinion though the rest of the album is good, it is unlike Cliffs of Dover in that the rest of the album is not as good.  That is, this album has 1 5 star song, a few 4 star songs, and a few that aren't really worth listening to.  It's all over the place in quality.<br \/>The next best track is Desert Rose, which is track 2.  It is different from Cliffs of Dover in that it has vocals, and that the guitar isn't quite as majestic.  I do enjoy the vocals, and they seem to be intellectual.  In addition, you could listen to any song on the album around children.  Though I'd call Desert Rose a 4 star song, it is somewhat of a letdown from Cliffs of Dover.  I hadn't heard this song, or any other songs on this album until I actually purchased, so I when I bought it, I thought I was going to get something different than what the album was in reality.  There it is.  Eric Johnson is putting me into the john by track 2.<br \/>Track 3 is somewhere between 3 and 4 star quality.  I like to listen to it.  I don't mind it when it is on.  Generally, when I listen to the album I let it play through, but I don't put the cd in the player to listen to this song in particular.  That said, between tracks one, two, and three, you may have something that you can put into a car cd player and enjoy, especially with a girlfriend, or wife.  This album is definitely family friendly music..<br \/>Before this album, so far as I know Eric Johnson was a nobody.  I have heard some of his early stuff and some of his later stuff, and it is about on par with this album.<br \/>I don't know if I would call Eric Johnson a virtuoso though often he is famed as one.  He is definitely a good guitarist, and he was even included on the first G3 live album, where his contribution is decent.  I think Eric Johnson is about as good as Eric Clapton, no better and no worse.<br \/>Track 4 is the first weak track on Ah Via Musicom.  It is terrible.  Though terrible tracks add to the lengths of albums, they detract from the album as a whole.  However, then Johnson rebounds with track 5, which is good enough to call a 4 star track.  I dare you to find one person that will honestly admit to loving this album most for track 4.<br \/>Thus, as an album, the quality of the song writing seems to vary drastically.  However, on the whole it is a great album, and it does have Cliffs of Dover, which is one of my all time favorite songs.  Ah Via Musicom is definitely worth purchasing, and if you like sophisticated, family friendly rock, I can almost guarantee that on the whole you won't be disappointed, but you may decide to skip through the tracks a bit, rather than listen to it as a whole.",

  "text":"Now there are a ton of Ray J haters out there. I personally, have never been a Ray J Hater. But I am also the first one to admitt, his first three album were all pretty much garbage. There were a few good songs on Raydiation, and a very few good songs on This Ain't a Game, but other than those few decent to good songs, the albums were a mess. The problem with Ray has always been he trys to get street cred when its not needed. Hes a R&B singer. He does not need to sing or in some cases even rap about drugs and guns. Theres no need to do that unless you are Akon. But Ray always has a tendency to drown down his albums with the pointless attempts to get street cred. And while its not as bad on this album as it has been in the past, it still shows up a little to much again on All I Feel. The attempted street banger \"Where U At\" with Game, is just terrible. The Game is good on this song, but he almost makes you forget Ray J's even on the track. It's just another attempt for Ray to try and gain street cred that he will never get. The same can be said for the other attempted thug track \"Real N*****\", Styles P is always good no matter who's song he is on, but Ray is just not that kind of singer. But the good news on this album, is that he does take on a more mature sounding approach to his R&B tracks. Take the title song \"All I Feel\" for example, these are the types of songs he should have all over his albums. Mid- tempo heartbreak songs with bass and some soaring synths. That song alone made the album better than his previous albums. Ray seems to have good luck with Rodney Jerkins, because the two best songs on the album are produced by him \"All I Feel\" and the more up tempo heartbreak song \"Jump Off\", where Ray again tells the story of how hes got two girls to choose from, but hes torn apart to make the decision. And overall thats where Ray is at his best, Heart ache songs. And its because while his vocals arent really on par with some of the elite singers of our day (R.Kelly, Mario, & Raheem Devaughn) he has the perfect voice to sing heart ache songs. But there is more than just that for good matireal on this album, take \"It's Up To You\" for example, its a more mellow\/laid back club song, where he pretty much says, hes making his money and hes getting his ladies. I know, we have heard that story time & time again, but its still a very catchy song. Overall i have to say I am proud of this album, because its the first time Ray J has made an album thats actually worth listening to more than one time. But at the same time, its still not amazing by any means, and there is still room for improvement. I guess by now, after four albums, i have come to expect this type of music from Ray J.

Every time you pull a liner out, it disrupts those around it, and over time they can get jumbled together and be a mess.  Still going to buy them, though.",

  "text":"My granddaughter loves receiving her packages every month. Some months she breaks into the toy as soon as she gets it, some months we put them away for rainy days. My only complaints are A) you never know what the item of the month is until after it ships, B) sometimes the item repeats so we have to return it, and C) sometimes the item is below the age group (i.e received an item marked 3+ for 5-7). It would be nice for Amazon to send out a message a day or two prior to shipping with the item description so that you can either pass on that month or select a back up item. I prefer the &#34;back-up item&#34; option because it would help avoid repeats as well.

  "text":"BMG has digitally reprocessed a complete 1958 \"Living Stereo\" recording by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra that gives a good sampling of the variety of music Fiedler programmed during his 50-year tenure (1929 to 1979) in Boston.<br \/><br \/>This album even features the original color photograph with Fiedler and some pretty women at a formal tea party.  It remains a delightful and enjoyable collection of light classics and even selections from popular films and musicals.<br \/><br \/>The Boston Pops Orchestra is drawn from members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and still gives many of its concerts in Boston's Symphony Hall.  A long tradition has been the Esplanade concerts on the Charles River.  Although pops concert began in the late nineteenth century, it was Fiedler who really popularized them through recordings, broadcasts, and even telecasts.  Beginning in July 1935, the Pops recorded for RCA Victor, a relationship that continued until the late 1960's.<br \/><br \/>The classical selections on this CD include a rare stereo recording of the overture to Michael Balfe's \"The Bohemian Girl,\" an operetta that was adapated for a Laurel and Hardy feature film released in 1936.  The overture features many of the familiar tunes from the operetta and those familiar with the film will recognize them.  It is extremely well-played by the orchestra.<br \/><br \/>A special treat is a wonderful performance of the overture to Otto Nicolai's opera \"The Merry Wives of Windsor.\"  This showcases the Boston strings and includes some very sensitive and virtuoso playing by the orchestra.  The only recording that may rival this one is Sir Thomas Beecham's recording for Columbia.<br \/><br \/>Fiedler excels in two familiar pieces from the operettas of Franz Lehar, \"The Merry Widow\" and \"The Count of Luxemburg.\"  These fully capture the Viennese spirit and have all of the ebb and flow typical of Lehar's music.<br \/><br \/>Another rarity is Bolzoni's \"Minuet,\" a piece that Toscanini often programmed.  It really showcases the string players.  Interestingly, Toscanini and Fiedler were friends.  Toscanini expressed his admiration for what Fiedler was doing and called him \"Arturo\" since they actually share variations of the same first name.<br \/><br \/>\"Hernando's Hideaway\" from the musical \"Pajama Game\" is delightfully performed.  There is considerable whimsy and energy in the performance, too, of music that has recently been revived on Broadway.<br \/><br \/>For the 1955 film adaptation of William Inge's \"Picnic,\" the popular tune \"Moonglow\" was combined with the film's theme to create a new tune, which was a highlight of the film when Kim Novak danced at the climax of the festivities (after being crowned a beauty queen).  This is yet another rare recording by Fiedler.<br \/><br \/>Fiedler was at the height of his powers in Boston when these selections were taped in Boston's Symphony Hall in the spring of 1958.  The album was quickly released later that year as RCA Victor flooded the classical market with a number of stereo LPs in its three-channel \"Living Stereo\" process.  It remains a very enjoyable album and the sound still amazes the listener.",

  "text":"Ring Fit Adventure<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ve got about 5 sessions in so I thought I\u2019d review the game so far. This is going to be long.<br \/><br \/>Where to begin! This is more than just a game. First, it comes with a yoga resistance ring as well as a thigh holster for one of the joy cons. Each session begins with putting one joy con in the thigh holster and attaching that to your leg as well as sliding the other joy con onto the resistance ring. You also have the software. There\u2019s a decent tutorial to get you started and on your way.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m not going to write much about the game play, storyline, characters etc. because you can find all that and more from watching YouTube reviews of the game. In general terms, you are inserted into an RPG style game in which you are trying to defeat a muscular dragon type villain, with the help of a talking ring personal trainer. There are a lot of details, big and small, to the game, that would take for ever to write about. So I\u2019m just going to stick to the hardware experience and why I bought it.<br \/><br \/>The Hardware: 5\/5<br \/><br \/>This game is a terrific vehicle for showcasing the Switch\u2019s unique hardware. It uses the vast array of sensors in each joy-con to tell the game what you are doing and where you are as you complete an exercise. Each exercise has a mini calibration before you begin. For example, the overhead press has you put your arms over your head holding the ring-con and hold that pose for a few seconds to make calibrate. Much of the game is of you jogging through the various levels and worlds. So the joy-con that\u2019s strapped to your leg captures your movement as you jog in place. It seems somewhat accurate. There will be times where you have to high step to run through water, run up stairs, etc. So the joy con on your leg has to measure that movement to make sure you\u2019re high stepping.<br \/><br \/>The ring-con is also pretty cool. Much of the game was you, for example, pushing in the ring with both hands to maneuver the game\u2019s menus, cycle through dialogue, selecting options on screen and so forth. It\u2019s basically a substitution for pressing buttons*. You also use the ring-con to move through the map by twisting the rin-con left or right, lifting it over your head or moving the ring-con to face the ground. It\u2019s also used to track arm movements as well as registering pushes and pulls on the ring-con. One other interesting feature: it utilizes the IR thing on the right joy-con to, get this, measure your heart rate. I compared it to my heart rate sensor on my fitness band and it isn\u2019t terribly accurate. It has only given me two readings, something like 178 if I\u2019m really working hard, or 140 for moderate exercise. I don\u2019t believe it varies at all between those two readings. Still cool, nonetheless.<br \/><br \/>*So the idea is, instead of pushing buttons on the controller to access menus, etc. you\u2019re still doing a physical movement, in between exercises, to move through the gameplay, such as rifling through dialogue, moving through the map or menus. If you\u2019re tired or you don\u2019t feel like squeezing the ring-con anymore, you can always use the x,y,a,b buttons instead. As far as the left joy-con is concerned, it\u2019s pretty much there to measure your lower body movements.<br \/><br \/>The only con I have with the hardware is I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to ruin the resistance. I\u2019m more of a strength guy versus agility. I will say this, I still get tired out doing the overhead press, but when I\u2019m doing the downward press, the one at waist high level, it\u2019s too easy. I\u2019m nearly touching both hands when pressing in (squeezing in). So hooray for me I guess but I don\u2019t want to have to buy a new ring-con.<br \/><br \/>Again, if you want to know more about the game play, graphics, all of those details, you\u2019ll get a more succinct review of that by watching a youtube video.<br \/><br \/>Why I bought it:<br \/>Ring Fit Adventure keeps you honest, provides manageable goals for fitness and exercising, really gives you a total workout from stretching both before and after, to working your upper and lower body as well as your core.<br \/><br \/>The long and the short of it is I can\u2019t begin to explain how well this game keeps you motivated, on track and consistently coming back to play and exercise again. It\u2019s certainly not because of the RPG elements, its the total package. It\u2019s a very polished tool to get in shape and enjoy doing it.<br \/><br \/>Things that stand out to me:<br \/>-it keeps a running timer of active exercising for each session, not just how long you\u2019ve been playing.<br \/>-It does a more than adequate job explaining each exercise, showing oyu how to do it and then making sure you\u2019re doing it right<br \/>-Again, very customizable. If it\u2019s been too easy, it may even prompt you to ask if you want to increase the difficulty level. You can also do it manually at any time. If it\u2019s too challenging, you can always decrease the difficulty level. It\u2019ll at times ask or suggest you to stop, probably based off the heart rate levels. It really does stress the importance of not doing too much too early and pacing yourself.<br \/>-As I\u2019ve played more and more, I notice that certain groups of levels or worlds focus on certain movements and exercises. For instance, today I found myself doing a ton of squats and doing this one yoga pose that worked my core. Also, I've noticed the cool down stretches aren\u2019t always the same and sometimes correspond with the previous session\u2019s exercises. For example, if most of the exercises I was doing concern themselves with arms, the static stretching at the end made sure they stretched my arms out. In other words, the exercises and stretches have been very purposeful so far.<br \/>-I really do get a good sweat going and find myself tired afterwards. I\u2019ve always had trouble pushing myself at the gym to the point of being really tired. So I think this game does a good job of making sure your time exercising was well worth it.<br \/>-although not too useful to me, but certainly applicable to young children, the game offers several varieties of tips and healthy suggestions towards proper nutrition, sleep, exercise habits and so forth that would be valuable to people who are still learning those things.<br \/><br \/>Things I don\u2019t like:<br \/>-Uneven exercise reps. Due to the nature of the game, as youre battling a foe, that bad guy may be at less than full health. Okay and you choose an exercise to finish him off. There are some exercises where you switch from one side of the body to the other, like the Warrior Pose #1. Today i found myself defeating a foe before I was able to switch from the left to the right side of my body, As a result, only my left side got the workout. It was a bit uneven. Now, im sure I could have paused the game and finished the set, but I was engulfed in the game and wanted to finish the battle.<br \/><br \/>-Kills your joy-con batteries. And I believe my right joy con\u2019s battery has been used more than the left one.<br \/><br \/>-Not sure of the durability of the ring-con. Like I said before, its fairly easy to push in the ring-con where my left and right knuckles almost touch. It would be cool if they could offer replacement ring-cons that have greater resistance.<br \/><br \/>-only a one player game. Other people can play it, but it has to be on their own profile. Maybe they could offer some DLC that has minigames that are multi-player. Not sure howd that work.",

  "text":"Rollicking, irreverent sitcom that turns the reality of the house shared by some spartan-living House Democrats into instead a  playground for scruple-free Republican Senators.  The conflicts and dramas showcased usually arise from the poor moral\/ethical choices the inhabitants make with of course hilarious consequences.  The senator from Utah is compelled to go to Afghanistan to visit the troops in order to squelch rumors that he is gay.  The senator from Florida is a serial Lothario and is balancing his need to stray while maintaining the affection of an uber-rich and single Hispanic benefactor.  The senator from PA is dodging indictment and censure and the senator and former BB coach from NC, portrayed by the excellent John Goodman is facing a primary challenge from another coach from his home state.  The slate of supporting actors includes the adorable Amy Sedaris in an unlikely role.  Worth the price, but a &#34;real deal&#34; on Amazon Prime.",

However, a caution to those with astute dogs.....It only took ONE time of taking the chew when it got too small for her to hold and I put it in the microwave to puff it up.  I then cooled it off and gave it to her.  She LOVED that even more (and made a crumbly mess).  The second chew I gave her, she kept dropping it in front of us and barking.  As soon as I walked toward the microwave, she lit up - eyes bright, alert and ears up!  I was amazed.  She now wants it in the microwave WAY before it is ready for it!!!!!",

I personally think that it was very thoughtful because the knife is very sharp. It is very balanced so when you are chopping up something very fast, you feel safe. There are knives out there that the blade part is so heavy and makes your hand hurt quickly. But this one is at its best. Not too light, not too heavy!<br \/>The blade part is white and as you can see in the pictures the sharp part looks like platinum. I just loved it so I might order the rest of the set too!",

  "text":"I started out in the PDA world with the iPaq 3835 PocketPC because I liked the beautiful high-res screen and needed the Word\/Excel compatibility for work. I never really considered Palm having the heavy-duty workhorse model I needed.<br \/>My friend introduced the Tungsten T to me, and it has been a real eye-opener. He demonstrated that the included software, Documents To Go, actually supports Word and Excel BETTER than PocketPC. More formatting is supported and unsupported formatting is not lost between syncs with PC and PDA. It even supports the occasional Lotus spreadsheets that cross my desk.<br \/>The screen is absolutely superb, and offers even higher resolution than my iPaq, at 320x320 I get even more columns on the screen. It's also incredibly bright, I now keep the brightness level at a mere 25%. Good for battery life too.<br \/>Needless to say, after his demo I took the plunge 2 weeks ago and I haven't regretted it. Along with the above features have come improved stability. I had gotten used to the occasional glitches in ActiveSync syncing and intermittent resets with iPaq, thinking it comes with the territory. After all, my Microsoft Windows 98 PC setup does the same :-). Yet, my new Tungsten device has been absolutely stable from the start. Although I have to initiate the syncs myself, I gladly trade having to push a button for the stability I gained. It's also so tiny, this PDA is much more pocketable.<br \/>I also like the 5-way dial pad feature. It allows one-handed operation of the handheld, which makes address lookups etc. very quick and easy. My friend pointed me to a little app called NewPen which greatly reduces the need to bring down the slider for the graffiti pad...which brings me to another thing, the graffiti is very easy to learn and after 2 weeks I write faster using it rather than the somewhat flawed handwriting recognition on the iPaq.<br \/>The Bluetooth phone+PDA setup seems pretty nice too, but I'm still stuck with an old-era old phone for now.<br \/>It would be nice if it came with a bit more memory so I bought an 64Mb SD card, which I can also share with my digital camera.<br \/>Overall, I'm very happy with my new PDA. The Tungsten T is an incredible device, it has all the features and stability you could ask for. If you are in the market for a PDA and size, screen quality, word\/excel, and stability are important to you, then go buy it. You won't be dissappointed.",

It\u2019s the perfect size for everyday carrying, and the magnetic closure makes it quick to get in and out of. The design is also elegant and professional, and since it is leather it matches tons of outfits.<br \/>The craftsmanship is also wonderful. Having done some leather working myself I can appreciate the skill that went into making this. Not only am I happy using this personally but I would feel confident giving it as a gift to a close friend because of its quality.",

  "text":"I'll admit, I've been a fan of this series since it first came out. To be honest, I'm a fan of all Naughty Dog's games. Yet, Jak II left me seriously considering abandoning the series. Not that it was a bad game(by any means). It was just there were moments in the game that were so insanely difficult that it left me cussing like a madman. Fortunately, I stuck it out and kept playing and it turned out to be an even better game than the first. Now, the third is upon us and I'm really impressed with it. You can play as both Dark Jak and Light Jack with new move sets, such as the ability to glide over great distances and more. There's an awesome arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods. Enemies fall with realistic ragdoll physics and that's not all. You get to drive a variety of vehicles, amongst other things. Sadly, this game concludes the story that began with The Precursor Legacy but it's good to see how the story ends. Naughty Dog made the series look even better with this one. Action\/Platformer fans are really going to love this one.<br \/><br \/>As of my writing this review, Naughty Dog has a PSP Daxter game planned, which I'm seriously looking forward to. Plus, Jak X:  Combat Racing. If you're a big Jak and Daxter fan...definitely look for these games when they debut.",

Well, a couple of years later and this may not star Billy Blanks (at least not yet), but it is exactly what I hoped for and more.  The way it creates a personalized fitness program and rewards you for meeting goals is very motivating, and the mini games are fun too.  I also noticed they have additional workouts for download over xBox Live, and a couple of them were free -- fantastic!  My only gripe would be the UI, which is a little slow (e.g. cycling one by one through all the skins by lifting and placing your foot) and is much quicker and more intuitive in other games like Dance Central.  Overall though this is fun and very well done and I'm keen to go back to it, which for some reason I can't say the same for EA Sports Active 2 (which shall now gather dust).",

  "text":"Much more so than the other two Anthology sets released by the Beatles, this set comes across as very deliberate and well-designed.  This is less a result of planning than the nature of the Beatles career.  CD one tracks their mastery of the pop art-form, while Disc 2 features their experimentation with the art-form and taking it further than anyone before them, and perhaps anyone since.  All the while, both discs echo each other, showing the consistency and creativity of the band itself.<br \/>The first &quot;Anthology&quot; tracks show their pop-mastery all too well.  While their early work was not significantly different than what other rock bands were producing, but this time, they had moved beyond their simple R&amp;B roots and found ways to infuse their work with a creative excellence which really perfected the pop genre.  Moreover, they are very dynamic songs.  The move from the pristine beauty of &quot;Yes It Is&quot; to the powerful drive of &quot;I'm Down&quot; and then back to delightful beauty of &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;.  What we hear in this set are the songs are presented in a more bare state than they would be released, but the genius comes through effortlessly.  This would be a focus of the set.  &quot;Yesterday&quot; without the strings is still absolutely perfect.  Likewise, Lennon's &quot;It's Only Love&quot; thrives without the strong guitar.  It is a wonderful way to experience these songs, with such a focus on the great vocals.  While all of this was going on, the more formulaic nature of the Beatles live shows offer a very different way of seeing the band.  Disc One again features a lot of the live tracks from these years, showing just how much the band had mastered live performance, often in spite of their audience.  The difference becomes all the more stark once we start to see the tracks from &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;.  The band was pushing pop music beyond what it was, but without abandoning the genre itself.  Some of the alternate takes are interesting, but not terribly powerful, but there are exceptions.  Notably, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; and the rehearsal of &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; offer a great look at some of the group's new works in a very different stage than we would come to know.  Compelling and fascinating, these tracks offer a glimpse at where the Beatles would go artistically following &quot;Revolver&quot; and on the second disc of this set.  Also, the strings only version of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; ought be mentioned, for it is a great reminder of how strong a producer and composer George Martin was.  While much of these discs show the unembellished masterpieces of the Beatles music, here we can really appreciated the embellished masterpiece of Beatles recordings.  These two purposes would be increasingly important after the Beatles abandon touring and concentrate on their studio work.<br \/>This duel focus is how Disc Two introduces itself, with three very different versions of the classic &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.  First is a demo version recording by John Lennon in his home.  The song is beautiful and the beauty isn't the least bit difficult to see in the barren demo recording.  From there we find a very different studio recording than would be eventually released.  Simple, but experimental, we can really get a picture of the song's nature as childhood remembrances.  Still, it was not what the composer wanted, so we also get treated to another later take on the song, which would be part of the final recording.  Familiar, yet new, we now experience the mastery of their recording in full.  Also, we hear an extended &quot;wild drum track&quot; from Ringo which does a lot to elevate him as a musician.  After a remixed version of Penny Lane, we move onto the recordings for &quot;Sgt. Pepper's...&quot;, the band's most highly regarded achievement artistically.  The version of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; found here is composed with the purpose of highlighting the creative work that went into putting this marvelous recording together.  Although artificial in nature, it is a fascinating way of presenting a historical look on the song while remaining an excellent track in its own right.  Later in the disc, the Reprise version of &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; is introduced in a much more powerful rendition than would find its way onto the album.  Also, the full version of the very experimental &quot;You Know My Name...&quot; is a real treat.  The rest of Disc Two is very strong and great to listen to.  &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; without George Martin's arrangement, a great demo of &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot;, and the fantastic early version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot;.  Disc Two has a host of great tracks that excel both as historical studies of the Beatles music and great versions of the songs in their own right.  It appeals to two different audiences, and makes this set a great pick-up for all Beatles fans.<br \/>As a last note, I do want to talk about the &quot;new&quot; track, &quot;Real Love&quot;.  This is really a masterpiece by all involved.  It is a beautiful song from John Lennon which is beautifully developed by the remaining members of the Beatles.  It is far superior to &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and really makes this play the infamous &quot;What if...&quot; game.  The band works together so well and so effortlessly, they cannot be considered anything less than the most artistically accomplished band in the history of Rock n' Roll.",

  "text":"A complex, well researched, dive into the story of cold case detective Everett Larkin and his partner, forensic artist Ira Doyal. In this 3rd installment of the Momento Mori series, they continue to work towards discovering the identity of the mysterious person sending them information about New York cold cases revolving around antiquated mourning rituals. Everett and Ira simultaneously work to uncover how a series of past deaths and disappearances of Times Square burlesque performers and sex workers are interconnected.<br \/><br \/>Poe keeps us fascinated with this well researched escapade into an obscure subcategory of New York City history, while still taking time to further explore the budding relationship and traumatic pasts of her complicated protagonists. The author doesn\u2019t disappoint, giving us plenty of twists, turns, heart pounding action, snappy dialog, obscure factoids, and emotional moments.<br \/><br \/>I have been reading each book as it is released. As the complexity of the story increases, I realize that I want to reread the books sequentially to get the full, undiluted effect and not miss any of the carefully arranged details. Broadway Butchery is a highly recommended addition to what is becoming a favorite mystery series.",

I will definitely reuse the barn box for other horse treats once all of these have been eaten. Second, my horse and my moms horse LOVE these treats. Like, they're crazy for them, lol. I had ONE of these treats in my pocket earlier when we went for a trail ride and my gelding would not stop trying to get it. I love that they're small and you can fit them easily in your pocket. They come in 3 shapes. A leaf, a sunflower, and a hibiscus. About the size of a quarter, maybe a bit bigger. Even my dogs like them. You do get quite a few in here. The treats are in a plastic bag inside the box. I would definitely repurchase since our horses are obsessed with them. This would also make a great gift for any horse owners in your life!",

  "text":"Bella has come to Driegon along with three other women to find husbands among the dragon like warriors there.  The King Malac is anxious for this to work out despite the critics as it will help to save his race.  He is there to greet the women and their entourage and finds himself drawn to Bella.  He is afraid she is his fated mate but does not want that to be true because he is being pressured to wed Jixon from a neighboring clan to cement a peace between the two clans.  He has not given his promise to take her as his mate but it would be best if he did.  That evening during  a reception for the four females and the warriors who could be their mates Bella is standing on a balcony all alone watching the King down in the garden as she is smitten with him.  All of a sudden she is shoved off the balcony and if it wasn\u2019t for the King\u2019s quick actions, he flew up from the garden to catch her before she hit the ground, she would have been killed.  When he touches her the Torrent starts and, Bella\u2019s arms burst into flames.  Malac knows this is the sign they are fated to be together and explains this to her.  Things are not that easy though.  Bella\u2019s heart yearns for Malac but she has had her heart broken before and she cannot have it broken again.  She does not trust Malac not to break it again so Malac has his work cut out for him.  Additionally Malac and Bella have to figure out why Bella was pushed off the balcony and then find him or her.  There are a lot of red herrings and lots and lots of romance.  This book is a page turner.

A continent divided into 3 parts, all ruled by Magoi families (or well.. mages) while the magicless (Hoi Polloi) live in fear for their lives, in poverty and starving. In this installment, we visit a lot of places, but everything was detailed and clear. Love how the mythology is woven into it!<br \/><br \/>Character development was excellent. Cat has got to keep her secrets close to her heart, no matter what happens or what she feels and Griffin, our infuriating stubborn warlord who doesn't really know how to handle her. Yeah, they are quite the pair :D<br \/>but you can really feel their growth and change of heart as the story progresses. They felt real, with real fears and desires and a stubborn streak that I can relate to haha.<br \/>Then we have Flynn and Kato who feel like brothers I never had. All the characters were well thought out and very well written.<br \/><br \/>Pacing and flow were equally super. Cat or one of the guys was getting into more trouble than anything else, so we had a lot of action, but the story still maintained a great balance between action\/excitement and conversation.<br \/><br \/>The book in itself was well written with no (noticeable) errors and yes, there is sex described in this installment (if that is important to you).<br \/><br \/>All in all, this was a great surprise!

  "text":"Bought these tires back in August of 2019. These are mounted my 2017 Honda Ridgeline. I've put approx 15K miles on them so far. They've performed very well thus far. I live in upstate NY on top of a big hill so we def get our share of snow, especially at our higher elevation. I've driven through some pretty severe snow storms too during some long road trips. These tires have performed very very well - waaay better compared to the standard OEM all seasons that came with the truck originally.<br \/><br \/>Keep in mind that that these are \"Severe Rated - All Seasons\" Per TireRack:<br \/><br \/>\"Beginning in the 13th week of 2017, all Crugen HT51 tires manufactured are branded with the three-peak mountain snowflake (3PMSF) symbol, indicating they are severe snow service rated. Tires manufactured before this date may not bear the 3PMSF symbol, but all Crugen HT51 tires meet the standards required for severe snow service rating.\"<br \/>\"Note: While non-winter tires featuring the three-peak mountain snowflake (3PMSF) symbol provide additional longitudinal snow traction beyond what all-season (M+S) tires not bearing the symbol can deliver, they do not match the capability of a true winter tire in all adverse weather conditions.\"<br \/><br \/>I was hoping that these would be a great bridge between All Seasons and Winter tires which would allow me to keep just 1 set of tires for my truck. So far, I'm extremely pleased with the performance - especially at the price of these tires.<br \/><br \/>Highly recommended!",

The intricacies of the Jim Crow South, mixing the hate, love, mental and physical anguish\/abuse with hope for a better life is all brought together in this heartbreaking narrative. Rozelle, in her diminished mental state, offers what she can to her children, including horrendous abuse. Touched on many areas needing discussion today in America: separation along color lines, why Black Lives Matter, understanding history and separation in the Black community.

If that doesn't sound like you, and you don't need to scan very large documents or textbooks very often, then you're better off looking for a more compact version!<br \/><br \/>That said, I do often print up to 13x19, and I am often scanning short sections out of textbooks for my wife's students.  The WF-7510 has handled both of these tasks beautifully.  Even over my admittedly crappy (currently) wifi network, this printed connected quickly and transfers data back and forth at a more than acceptable rate.  Setup was easy, just finding my wireless router and inputting the password via the small menu screen.  I set up drivers on my main computer but my laptop was able to connect and print to it without downloading the software from Epson (I'm sure Windows update handled the drivers in there, as they supported the special features of the printer).  I've scanned several documents and the scan quality is quite good, and scanning straight to PDF produces clean files at manageable sizes for e-mailing.  I haven't had to go in and play with the scanning options too much to get perfectly acceptable output.<br \/><br \/>I have printed a few proofs for different design projects and the output is great, even on regular paper.  I haven't used up too much of the ink yet, so the next step is seeing how much this beast drinks!<br \/><br \/>The printer is pretty big though, but it doesn't feel like any of that space is wasted.  It has a nice clean design with no unnecessary bits and bobs sticking out everywhere.  While it is, of course, plastic, it feels sturdy and doesn't suffer from flexing and creeking everywhere.  And when it's not in use, closing up the feeder and the output tray makes it look like a nice, neat little package.<br \/><br \/>If you're looking for an inkjet printer that truly does it all, and up to some pretty large sizes, this is a great choice.",

Very early in the disc, I began to smile and laugh out loud and this persisted throughout the entire performance, including the name credits at the end--which if you see it, you will understand why, again, I laughed out loud.  David Blair was a very strong and likeable alpha male dancer.Nadia Nerina is thechnically exquisite and sooooo cute, albeit she is slightly older than some prima ballerinas. but her mannerisms are very charming and her proportions are just about perfect. The entire production was staged for TV and it is beautiful..The preformance that could rival this one for sheer joy and good humor is the splenidid Australian Ballet production with  a vibrant David MacAllister as Colas and the exceengly lovely Fiona Tonkin as Lise.  I would not be without either one.  There are three other versions of which I am aware.  There are two others with the Royal ballet that do not convey the sheer joy of dance to the extent of of my two favorites. however they are technicallly superb.  The other is with the Basler Ballet, which is surprisingly good.  This performance has little resemblence to Ashton's choreography.

  "text":"Bought this as a gift for a friend, her little one loves this play pen, and it\u2019s large enough for an adult or two to hang out with baby too. One downside is that the crossbars being X shaped rather than straight, makes them (1) easy targets for baby to bump their head when still learning to walk, and (2) when baby is a bit older, the X makes a nice foothold for climbing. That said if you monitor the kid they\u2019ll be fine. My only other complaint is a criticism of ALL play pens, they  should come with padding underneath (to protect baby from hitting the floor too hard) but none of them seem to, and this one is no exception. So you\u2019ll need to buy foam pads or something soft to go under the playpen.",

This record takes about 5 or so listens to truly appreciate (although the first listen is certainly pleasant enough).  Also, the record builds -- the second half is much stronger than the first.  The Arcade Fire took me about ten listens to really \"get it.\"  This album -- although not as great -- is comparable in that respect.

Yes, I know it was a very long movie, but the movie will make such an impact on you that you'll never notice.  It is ALOT better then that other sappy disaster movie, DEEP IMPACT.  DEEP IMPACT was more of an emotional movie while ARMAGEDDON is more of an action thrill ride.  Although most people prefer DEEP IMPACT, I would rather would watch this.  Here is the plot.<br \/><br \/>When a space shuttle and half of New York city is unexpectantly destroyed by a meteor shower, NASA tracks down another cosmical object heading toward for us.  The difference, is that this one is enormous, it the size of Texas.  And to make matters worse, we only have 18 days to destroy it-BEFORE IT DESTROYS US!  Now, the only was to demolishing it is by planting a nuclear weapon 800 feat below it surface.  In order to do that, NASA must get the Worlds best deep core driller.  That guy is Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his crew AJ (Ben Affleck), \"Chick\" Chappelle (Will Patton), Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan), Max (Kan Campbell), Oscar (Owen Wilson), Freddy Noonan (Clark Bolly), and Rockhound (Steve Buscemi).  These have 12 days to train how to become astronauts.  All the time in the world is all they've got.<br \/><br \/>In my opinin, I think this is the best movie directed by Michael Bay.  Its has all sorts of great elements- Action, comedy, and drama.  Sure the plot is a little obscure, our fate is in the hands of a bunch of oil drillers?  I know it sounds dumb, but it does make a great pop corn flick.  What was also good about this movie was the relation ship between AJ and Harry's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler).  Besides the asteroid, the movie was also centered around that relationship.  AJ and Grace love each other however Harry does not like AJ.  Loving Grace was sort of the real reason why AJ was saving the World.  He is doing for her.  And slowly throughout the movie, AJ was earning Harry's respect.<br \/><br \/>Now let me talk about this DVD.  I suggest getting the regular edition DVD, not the criterion collection.  I remeber paying alot of money for the criterion collection, and while the movie is fantastic, the dvd lacks even though is is a 2 disc set.  Every piece of veiwing material on the 2nd disc is only ten minutes.  I can probobly watch everything on the second disc in less then 45 min.  It surely was not worth the 30 plus dollars, I suggest getting the regular single disc edition.  It won't have as much x-tras, but it will be a better buy.",

I understand, just like all TV shows, it is not for everyone, probably especially for hardcore truests for Star Trek canon.  For other sci-fi fans, this could be a real treat.",

  "text":"To start, a lot of people here seem to be confused about what they are ordering. This is essentially a Nintendo pro controller that has been fashioned in the shape of a GameCube controller. It will even be recognized by the Switch as a pro controller. If you are a Smash purist and you want the long analog trigger press of a GameCube controller, then you need an actual GameCube controller and an adapter.<br \/><br \/>For what it is, I love this controller. After some bad experiences, I've avoided third party controllers for many years. Getting this was a huge gamble to me that has paid off in spades, particularly considering the price. I already own several GameCube controllers, but dealing with the adapters and lack of home button is a hassle. This controller lets me do away with all of that. I get the motion controls, wireless, and full functionality of the pro controller with the button mashing friendly styling of the GameCube controller. This is now my preferred controller for most games on the Switch.<br \/><br \/>My only complaints are that the controller runs on AA batteries rather than a rechargeable and the plastic, while surprisingly rigid, looks a bit cheap compared to the actual GameCube controller.",

  "text":"An incredible product.  Is it worthwhile to get a subscription?  That depends on how up to date you like being and how many machines you have.  The incredible value with Office 365 now is the unlimited cloud storage in OneDrive that comes with it and can be given to up to five unique users.  That alone is worth $100 a year.  You can keep every photo, video, music file, etc on OneDrive and access it on any phone, tablet, or computer with an internet connection.<br \/><br \/>Yet you also get Office Professional on up to 10 machines (5 PCs\/Macs, 5 tablets).  This also means you do not get left behind when a new version of Office hits or when new apps are added to Office.  For instance, Office 2016 is likely to have at least two more new applications in it that may change how productivity is done.  Microsoft Sway is an incredible, intuitive presentation program that is a new take on what Powerpoint does, adding more in some ways while being able to create a multimedia presentation in a simple way.  If you just purchase the current version of Office, you get left out and have to spend more money next year as more and more people begin using the new products.  Office 365 protects you against that.  It also allows for easy activation and deactivation of devices, making Office more portable than ever.<br \/><br \/>One last feature is the stackability of the subscription.  There are times that you may find Office 365 on sale here or elsewhere.  Maybe an Office 365 card is marked down to $80.  You can buy one or more, add them to your account, and stack years of subscriptions.  Or you can go buy a cheap tablet, get an Office Personal subscription, upgrade it for $20 to Home Premium, and add it to your current subscription.  This means years of Office Professional and years of unlimited OneDrive storage.<br \/><br \/>This is a great deal at this point with Skype minutes, unlimited cloud storage on the most cross platform cloud service, OneDrive, and Office Professional with all new versions included.",

  "text":"I've purchased four zapper rackets from Amazon so far:<br \/><br \/>Elucto  2-wire \/ 2xAA battery \/ 3200~3500 volts<br \/>Black Flag  3-layer \/ 2xAA battery \/ 2750 volts<br \/>Lanpuly  3-layer \/ USB rechargeable lithium-ion battery \/ 4000 volts<br \/>ZapIt !  3-layer \/ USB rechargeable lithium-ion battery \/ 4000 volts<br \/><br \/>The Rechargeable Zap It! is by far the best, due to the grid design and higher voltage.  Here's what I've learned so far:<br \/><br \/>3-layer is better than 2-wire<br \/>Examples of 2-wire, single-layer designs include Executioner and Elucto.  To be zapped, the bug must touch 2 wires. It works well for larger bugs but in my experience, small gnats pass right between the wires with no effect.<br \/><br \/>The more common 3-layer design has an inner \"hot\" grid separated from the outer \"ground\" layers with plastic spacers.  To be zapped, part of the bug has to go far enough in the mesh to touch the center grid.  You'd think it would be less effective\u2026 but in my testing, it works equally well on large bugs \u2026 and much better on small flying gnats.<br \/><br \/>USB rechargeable lithium-ion battery is better than AA battery<br \/>Zapper rackets are usually powered by two AA batteries or a single USB rechargeable lithium ion battery.  AA battery powered zappers are rated between 2750 & 3500 volts while USB rechargeables can go as high as 4000 volts.  It\u2019s a difference you can see and hear \u2026 and the higher voltage improves the chances of a kill.<br \/><br \/>ZapIt ! USB Rechargeable is the best I've tried<br \/>One way to test a zapper racket is to press it against the foliage of a plant with small leaves.  It shows how sensitive it is (how many sparks) and how powerful it is (how loud are the cracking sounds)<br \/><br \/>Lanpuly was the first 4000 volt, USB-rechargeable racket I purchased.  Doing the foliage test, it didn't work nearly as well as the Rechargeable ZapIt!<br \/><br \/>The voltage is the same so what's different?  It turns out the internal gaps between the 3 layers in the Lanpuly are wider \u2026 so bugs are less likely to touch the center layer.  The ZapIt! grid spacing is closer and in the foliage test, it produces far more and louder sparks.<br \/><br \/>For use on bugs, it's also the best I've tried.  As an example of the power and sensitivity, I placed the face of the Rechargeable ZapIt! on a silverfish on the carpet.  The result was a loud display of sparks like the 4th of July !  The silverfish was vaporized \u2026 and the snapping, crackling sounds were so loud that they startled my wife in the next room !<br \/><br \/>There are three sizes:  Mini 16\" long x 6.3\" wide \/ Medium 18\" long x 7.6\" wide \/ Large 19\" long x 8.3\" wide.  I've tried the Medium and Large and recommend the Medium as the slimmer grip makes it easier to snap your wrist back and forth while also having to hold the power button down with your thumb. There's no reason to get the Mini in my opinion.<br \/><br \/>Note: Amazon also sells ZapIt! rackets powered by 2xAA batteries that are only rated for 3500 volts.  Unless USB charging is not available, that option is not recommended.<br \/><br \/>Tip: an iPad USB charger charges faster than a smaller iPhone \"cube\" charger<br \/><br \/>I hope this information is helpful !",

It really is impossible to fully understand the unique role each played in this grand drama without the context of the interplay of their actions and decisions in their respective areas of responsibility, notably including that of Admiral Leahy as Chief Military Advisor to President Roosevelt.The crucial but lesser known roles of Admirals King and Leahy are laid out in a way that the reader gains a new perspective and much deeper understanding of the many critical factors that led to the Allied victory in the war. Moreover, the rich details regarding personalities and events infused into this story make for a work of scholarship and great writing that must be ranked with the very best of the many great stories of a war that was like no other in human history.",

  "text":"This is a condensed version of the \"Complete Columbia Album Collection\". The mini-LP sleeves are the same design as in that set (albeit renumbered for this set), and the CD masterings appear to be the same. (For instance, the version of \"We Want Miles\" is the same as in the \"Complete\" boxed set with the extra tracks from the Tokyo show). As such, this is ideal for someone who wants a nice collection of key highlights from all phases of Davis' Columbia career, but finds the \"Complete\" collection overkill or prohibitively expensive.",

The sound quality is definitely better than my old \"Skullcandy\" earphones, and the volume control is a nice touch. Although, the volume control is a really minor bonus -- there isn't a great deal of range that you can change the volume. But, you use the volume on your device and it's no big deal at all. The noise cancellation is also better than my Skullcandy set. I was able to listen to classical music while riding on the NYC trains, at only about 30% volume level of my device, and had great clarity. Of course, if things ever got *really* loud outside, I couldn't hear anything (and I'm protective of my hearing, so I don't turn up the volume to compensate for outside noise).<br \/>In any case, a great set of earphones, and the design will be very useful to runners and anyone else who uses them for exercise, since they stay in place. They're supposed to be waterproof, too -- as in, sweat-proof. I don't really know how to test that. Even when I've sweated with any other set of earphones, I never had a problem. Enjoy!!",

  "text":"After the sweeping success of 1973's now iconic \"INNERVISIONS\"<br \/>album had established Stevie Wonder as a creative force of nature<br \/>in music who was one of the ones who was on the van garde of where<br \/>music was going in the 1970's and beyond, the inevitable question<br \/>arose a year later in late summer 1974 of \"Could he top Innervisions?\"<br \/>or \"Could he keep the same level of artistic quality and excellence<br \/>which he'd already established on his previous two albums leading up<br \/>to this one?\"  Well, as it turned out, the answer was a resounding YES!!<br \/>The near-fatal freak car accident which almost took Stevie away from<br \/>the world at the height of his creative powers just after the release of<br \/>INNERVISIONS in 1973 had made him a much more introspective and<br \/>soul-searching individual who was taking inventory of his life<br \/>so far, the people in which he surrounded himself, what was the purpose<br \/>for him now that he'd been spared from death, how could he use his gifts<br \/>to further enrich people's lives, and many other questions which one<br \/>puts to themselves in that situation.<br \/><br \/>Stevie, being the musical genius he is, began to formulate the tones,<br \/>timbres, chord progressions, lyrical ideas and vocal expressions he was<br \/>feeling inside into the album that was to become the next masterpiece in<br \/>his incredible 1972-76 multi-platinum, multi-grammy & AMA, highly acclaimed<br \/>\"classic period\"....FULFILLINGNESS' FIRST FINALE!! (-:<br \/>From the opening song, the joyous \"Smile Please\" to the<br \/>faith-through-cynicism anthem \"Heaven Is 10 Zillion Light Years Away\",<br \/>to the pretty, brief and country music-tinged \"Too Shy To Say\" to<br \/>the perculating gravely moog bass and dancing piano of the funky<br \/>\"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" to the smooth & mellow, dream-like \"Creepin'\"...<br \/>Stevie knew how to create an atmosphere in his music at that time<br \/>which was unlike what anybody else was doing at that time.<br \/>Side Two began with a funktified clavinet groove leading into another<br \/>1970's funk classic with a message in the vein of \"Superstition\" and<br \/>\"Higher Ground\", \"You Haven't Done Nothin'\" came on the heels of<br \/>the Nixon administration being exposed for the crooks they were and<br \/>Nixon himself being impeached from office. The song was a definite<br \/>slam to that administration and the fact that the Jackson 5 had added<br \/>their \"doo-doo-whops\" in there to Stevie's call and response<br \/>political commentary made it a sure fire lead single which<br \/>zoomed to the top of the R&B and Pop charts!<br \/>Black, White, Latino, Asian...it didn't matter!<br \/>Everybody was loving Stevie Wonder's music at this time!<br \/>He was a worldwide phenom and was breaking records and setting<br \/>precedences left and right with everything he did.<br \/>Here was a 24 yr old blind black musical artist who had full creative<br \/>control over his material, unprecedented commercial & artistic<br \/>success, the respect of the music industry and other musicians<br \/>in addition to his millions of fans!---This was truly his moment!<br \/>From the raw boogie down funk of \"You Haven't Done Nothin\",<br \/>Stevie shifts gears to a groovy smooth breakup song called<br \/>\"It Ain't No Use\", which features backing vocals by the likes of<br \/>Deniece Williams and Minnie Ripperton among others.<br \/>This song is one of my underrated favorites of Stevie's non-single<br \/>material because it just feels so good when I hear it.<br \/>From this, he goes into the very melancholy and introspective<br \/>sparse, almost classical-sounding piano piece with a mournful<br \/>black gospel choir background with a splash of Arp 2600<br \/>and Moog bass in there for good measure....the very unique<br \/>\"They Won't Go When I Go\", where Stevie talks about one day being<br \/>able to go to a very positive & free space (if he's lived a good life)<br \/>where he'll be free from the pain, deceit, greed, phoniness,<br \/>manipulation and ugly side of mankind!<br \/>This song is powerful and goes straight to your core!<br \/>As evidenced by how many people have \"attempted\" to cover it<br \/>through the years, most namely, George Michael's 1990 version,<br \/>which is good but comes nowhere near the original, as well as<br \/>how many people have selected this song for their funerals,<br \/>I'd say Stevie's message has resounded through space & time!<br \/>On July 7th 2009, Stevie Wonder himself performed the song<br \/>poignantly in tribute to the memory his good freind,<br \/>the late Michael Jackson, who'd died on June 25th.<br \/>When you reflect on the last 17 yrs of MJ's life, those lyrics<br \/>that Stevie delivered so soulfully some 35 yrs before,<br \/>rang dead on true!<br \/>He closes this brilliant album out with the brazilian-flavored<br \/>\"Bird Of Beauty\", which talks of utilizing the spiritual high<br \/>we all possess inside to deal with life's ups and downs instead<br \/>of falling prey to the pharmaceutical highs of drugs.<br \/>Then there's the very upbeat and melodic \"Please Don't Go\",<br \/>which sounds like something Ray Charles could've cut in his<br \/>hey-day if he'd had access to synthesizers back then.<br \/>It's just a feel good track that ends the album on an upbeat note.<br \/>Of course, this album, just like \"Talking Book\" and \"Innervisions\"<br \/>before it, topped the R&B and Pop Charts, swept the awards season<br \/>of 1975, and carried Stevie's legend further along.<br \/>There would be no actual album released in 1975, which is where<br \/>the famous Paul Simon grammy quote thanking Stevie for not releasing<br \/>an album in 1975, when he won the album of the year in 1976 comes from.<br \/>But little did they know though (at the time!), that Stevie Wonder<br \/>was busy at work crafting what would become his magnum opus and<br \/>the perfect cap off to his incredible \"classic period\"....<br \/>Late 1976's 2 1\/2 disc watershed masterpiece \"Songs In The Key Of Life\"!!

  "text":"There are very few albums of the 2000s that look like they'll be viewed as \"classics\" in years to come; the kind of albums that change the way people view music, maybe even inspire them to start bands of their own. This is definitely that kind of album.<br \/><br \/> What is it about it that makes it so good? Though this may seem like a digression from the main point of the review, the band's history is inseparably intertwined with their music. The Libertines is a band that ended up attracting a very devoted, loyal fan-base in the UK. The songwriting partnership of Pete Doherty and Carl Barat appears unlikely from a technical aspect, since they are actually quite different (both music and personality-wise). However, their varied vocal and lyrical styles complement each other rather harmoniously. Besides, they had the same objective: to play music, get it heard, and get signed!<br \/><br \/> The popular British music magazine, NME, heavily promoted the band from their early days up until their demise. The success of The Strokes, a successful American band at the forefront of the \"garage rock revival\", helped open the door for The Libertines to get signed to a record label (Rough Trade). Over time, The Libertines became well-known for their intense, impassioned live shows, including performances held for fans at their own house! They popularized a \"mythology\" of the band in some of their song lyrics and interviews: The Libertines were hypothetically \"sailing the good ship Albion (also an archaic name for Britain) to Arcadia\", a utopian land without rules or authority. This notion has been particularly important to Pete, as he has continued these references in his subsequent band, Babyshambles. It embodies the poetic spirit of The Libertines very well, as it is a metaphor for Carl and Pete's 'quest' to revive a sort of British romanticism in music.<br \/><br \/> The Libertines' style is mainly reminiscent of 70s British punk-rock bands (especially The Clash). Then again, there are a few slower and heartfelt tracks, like \"The Good Old Days\", \"Tell the King\", and \"Radio America\", which show the more literary side of the band, as opposed to the cocky, modern tone of tracks like \"Up the Bracket\", \"The Boys in the Band\", and \"I Get Along\". The whole album is varied enough to be interesting and enjoyable, and the band's incredibly distinctive style is a result of Pete and Carl's mixed influence of music and literature alike. The Libertines' debut, \" Up the Bracket\", has made quite an impact on contemporary British music and will (hopefully!) continue to affect music overall for many years to come.",

  "text":"This garbage &#34;can&#34; is perfect for my new car!<br \/><br \/>I just recently bought a convertible, and as you can imagine you can't really have loose trash floating around in the floorboards while the top is down. My husband suggested just tying a plastic bag somewhere but that is boring and ugly! :( I looked for something useful but also nice to look at. That's when I found this &#34;can&#34;! I keep saying &#34;can&#34; because it's more like a bag or a sack than an actual can.<br \/><br \/>The exterior of the bag is a canvas material and feels very sturdy. The design is part of the canvas itself, not printed on, so I am not worried about it fading weird or chipping off. The inside of the bag is a silver plastic fabric, like the inside of a lunch box. This will be easy to clean if something gets spilled on it. I have decided to put a plastic bag inside this bag though, to keep it clean and for easy dumping when it's full. The bag has a strap at the top that loops around your head rest and there is a strap with a hook coming from the bottom to hook it under the seat. This keeps the bag very sturdy, even when I go down the highway with the top down. The sides of the bag has 2 mesh pockets! These are great for holding extra plastic bags or any other odds and ends you have floating around the car. I sometimes put my cell phone in the pocket closest to me, I can see the display through the mesh if I need it and I know it won't fly away! The absolute best feature of the bag, in my opinion, is that the top of the bag has a metal banding in it and it will fold shut with a Velcro closure. This is great for me, because convertible, but it would also be a good way to keep little kids hands out of the trash!<br \/><br \/>Overall this is a stylish and handy garbage bag!<br \/><br \/>I received this product at a discount for my honest review.",

  "text":"I\u2019m absolutely loving this series and all the characters Lauren Blakely has been creating. I would love to spend a few hours with her and see how she creates the magic that she does.<br \/><br \/>The storyline begins with Reese interviewing an up and coming baseball player named Holden. They have an insta chemistry that neither wants to deny. However, fate and timing overrule this relationship. Fast forward two years when they meet again and the same heat and passion is there. Life throws another curveball in their way. Sometimes second chances can be hard.<br \/><br \/>Holden is absolutely dreamy. A professional baseball player who lives for the game but is also grounded. He plays hard so he can one day take care of his parents who sacrificed a lot for him. And Reese? Best friend goals. Independent and knows what she wants. We all need a Reese in our lives.<br \/><br \/>My favorite part was getting all the little hints for the upcoming books. All the books flow flawlessly together but also stand apart that you can\u2019t pick a favorite Lauren Blakely book. For the rest of the summer and autumn, she\u2019s publishing some awesome books.

  "text":"I had always wanted a Jeep, but never had the luxury of buying a vehicle based solely on 'want' instead of 'need'. 2 years ago, I purchased my first Jeep. 2Dr Wrangler Sport. I drove it home, took off the top and never put it all back on again. I have the 3-piece freedom top and have put on the front panels if it's raining ( I live in SoCal so maybe 4 times a year). 4 months after purchase I took the doors off. I only put them back on for long road trips. Only mods have been 32 inch tires, aftermarket mirrors, and foot pegs. I've taken road trips to Washington, Nevada, Oregon and one 4kplus loop that took me all the way up to Glacier Natl Park. Been off-road in eight states, but I'm mainly on roads. This is my ride to work, my softball-dad mobile, and my dogs favorite way to get around. Road\/wind noise with no top is there, but I have the wind in my hair and sun on my face to compensate. Also people love this car like no other! My daughters friends all want to ride in it every chance they get. Little kids are constantly waving at me, and some of their moms too ;).<br \/>In short, this has been, hands down, my favorite vehicle in 34 years of driving.",

Most lighted keyboards are hideous or bulky (in my opinion).<br \/><br \/>I was slightly concerned about the reviews claiming the keys wear off in 3-4 weeks, but my guess is that these comments are coming from people that pound on the same 4-6 keys for hours a day.  For the gamer who does not play FPS this keyboard is great.  I definitely can see how a FPS gamer would wear the paint off the keys in a short amount of time, but a non FPS gamer should not have a problem with this (at least not for many months & hundreds of hours of use).",

  "text":"With the majestic and otherworldly grandeur of superlatively crafted concepts and creative colors worthy of the largest of cinema screens and most adept of imaginations, K.M. Weiland's Dreamlander is simply one of the best self-contained genre-bending epic novels I've ever had the privilege of reading for a great many reasons. At the heart of the story's many successes is the truest nature of its unbridled sense of adventure and the magnitude of such timelessness is set in stone by a bevy of unforgettable characters living in two very different worlds. The pacing of this complex story is magnificently swift and the bouncing back and forth between Chicago and Lael was not only refreshing to read but essential to the dynamic plot. The drama never stops, constantly and faithfully climbing to a gratifying and poignant climax like a slowly bowed cello with dozens of violins furiously harmonizing in the background; Dreamlander pleases on all levels. The combat and warfare, given the deadly serious tone it deserves, is gritty and realistically reminiscent of the Civil War or Revolutionary War. Lael itself seems to be a world you don't want to leave and Allara Katadin and Chris Redston romantically dance with the subtext-soaked tragedy reserved for heroes destined to love amidst the chaos of a dually world-rending war. If you're on the fence about reading this, don't be. It's a winner and then some. Buy a copy for yourself and tell everyone you know. Thank you K.M. Weiland for living the dreams. You are the Gifted.",

First the hit of the album &quot;9 to 5&quot;, this song spent 1 week at #1 on the country charts, 2 weeks at #1 on both the Hot 100 and the A\/C chart. Another hit from the album was &quot;But You Know I Love You&quot;, a song about being on the road away from a lover, spent one week at #1 on the country charts. The album has a bunch of other great songs, &quot;Dark as a Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Deportee (Plane Wreck at los Gatos)&quot; are so heartbreaking, Dolly at her best. I love &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;, Dolly does justice on this one. Other highlights include &quot;Sing For The Common Man&quot;, &quot;Working Girl&quot;, and more. Overall great album!",

You get compression, a gate\/expander, phantom power, and high\/low tone controls.<br \/><br \/>I ran a signal through a spectrum analyzer and discovered those tone controls work very much like you would expect them to. There's nothing tricky about them, it's just a gentle high shelf and gentle low shelf which is exactly what you want.<br \/><br \/>The compressor and expander\/gate have limited controls, but they're setup so that pretty much anyone could operate them by ear and the default settings \"just work.\" I don't find myself needing additional attack or release for vocals or voiceover.<br \/><br \/>I measured the gain stage and the dbx 286s offers very clean preamplification. You have to turn it up all the way into the red to get any harmonic distortion, but don't hesitate to do that if you like the sound... While the red light looks scary, it's just the kind of saturation you might get from a plugin except this has no foldback distortion since it's analog.<br \/><br \/>Sometimes you hear negativity about this device in audio production forums --- after my analysis I'm convinced some people resent it because you get so much bang for the buck.

  "text":"Kathy Connor Dobronyi\u2019s Under the Wings of a Good Luck Phoenix is a smooth ride that glides more like a novel than non-fiction. Dobronyi\u2019s writing style is smooth and accessible, her voice both endearing and humorous.<br \/>  Her memoir brings the reader into a year in the life of her military family as Americans in Saigon near the beginning of the Viet Nam conflict. As a reader, I feel immersed in this well-drawn picture of history that influenced my own generation\u2014with an on-the-ground view of 1963 Saigon and an engaging lead character, Dobronyi as a child. The narrative invites me to see events from a thought-provoking four-legged stance. The clueless and privileged expatriates. The American military, who see and should know the truth. The helpless citizens who cannot escape their history. And the girl wandering the picturesque and dangerous streets.<br \/>  Nam, young Kathy\u2019s mentor and friend, serves as a servant to the Connor family He provides a view of real life in the life and times of Viet Nam and a look, through his eyes, at the privileged Americans occupying his country. The moment when the family leaves for safety in the U.S.A, Nam looking after them, is a miniature portrait of our countries in the 60\u2019s. One retreating , the other abandoned. I am thankful to have read this eye-opening account of history.<br \/>Judith Kammeraad",

  "text":"We had tried everything imaginable to keep deer from eating our flowers and plants:  ultra-sound, powdered blood, other chemicals, noise-makers, deer-sticks that shock deer that touches them, you name it.  Some of these worked for a while but invariably the deer got accustomed to them and put up with them while foraging.  They had done an especially thorough job on our azaleas - they love to eat the buds, and we saw only a handful of azalea flowers for years.  Enter the motion-activated sprinkler.  When activated by motion, it squirts water with considerable force while quickly covering a significant area.  Deer hate to be startled and they hate to be hosed.  Scarecrow does both:  it starts up noisily and squirts so fast that deer have no chance to leave the area before getting hosed.  Ever since we installed a couple of scarecrows, the deer left our azaleas alone - and they are blooming spectacularly this year.  Issues?  First, they run on 9 Volt batteries.  While that avoids the complications and hazards of long electrical wires, the battery life is quite short, a few weeks in our experience.  We have other battery-operated valves - in a water timer, for example, that last more than one season despite daily cycling.  Scarecrow, by contrast, needs new batteries several times in a season.  Another issue is inherent to the use of water outdoors:  freezing.  We addressed this issue by disconnecting the scarecrow's feeder hose at the outside faucet.  On mild frost nights it suffices to cover the faucet (and timer) with burlap or other cloth.  We did not bother to drain the scarecrows themselves - and got away with it even though the temperature dipped into the teens this winter.  Another issue is that scarecrow cannot distinguish between deer and people and will hose whoever triggers their bulit-in motion detector.  That is where a timer valve comes in.  Our timer connects scarecrows with water supply only during set hours (8 PM to 7 AM).  A note of caution here:  most of the electrical water timers around are of poor design and poor quality.  We tried a handful of them and had to return each to the store because they broke or never worked as advertised.  We finally bought a timer at more than twice the cost of the el cheapos and are completely satisfied with it.  Most importantly - it works reliably, it is well designed and of high quality, and it has already lasted several seasons - while the el cheapos lasted for days to a week or two - if they worked at all.  So - if you need a timer (to protect people from the scarecrow), shop for quality - not for price.  A timer at half price may attract you - but it's hardly worth the money if it lasts only for days or weeks instead of years.",

  "text":"Not the final Beatles LP released (that was the year-old \"Let It Be\" in the spring of 1970, by which time the band had already fallen apart), \"Abbey Road\" comes off like a product of four estranged musicians only with the benefit of hindsight. Today we know the back story: i.e. that Paul had pretty much seized control of the whole enterprise, that the bandmates were barely on speaking terms with one another and that this was a final attempt at making an album. It's hard to hear much of that alienation in the cohesive and involved group interaction on display here; unlike the White Album, this comes together as a whole, and makes for a graceful exit from the stage. If this sounds like the work of a band on its best behavior, it's also unmistakably the work of a band, period. One shudders to think of the Beatles going on autopilot and sticking around for two or three further albums, each more disengaged than its predecessor.<br \/><br \/>Sure, it's likely that the \"suite\" that comprises most of what was originally Side 2 was an inspired \"make lemonade out of lemons\" salvage job of unfinished fragments that the group was in no mood to flesh out into complete songs, but the effect is breathtaking rather than scattershot.

  "text":"[[VIDEOID:c48782e43a926aba138b87fe735699e2]] The Play Doh Prettiest Princess Castle is a perfect toy for a girl (or boy) who loves the Disney Princesses. It provides the fun of Play Doh and the *enchantment* (I am sorry I just had to use that word!) of the Disney Princesses. The set comes complete with Cinderella, Aurora (Sleeping Beauty), and Belle as small figurines that fit into dress makers in the castle (see the video). It also allows you make Rapunzel's hair grow in the tower, and to use the drawbridge to make a Play Doh Prince Charming!<br \/><br \/>Notes-<br \/><br \/>- Assembly is not perfect, and will require an adult but can be put together in less than 5 minutes (make sure you follow the directions).<br \/><br \/>- Each of the three princesses can fit into the castle so that can be fitted into a Play Doh Dress. The dresses can then be fitted with as Play Doh accessories as can be reamed up!<br \/><br \/>- Comes with 6 small canisters of Play Doh - Purple, Pink, Red, Gold, Blue, and Yellow<br \/><br \/>- Staying Power - will your child still be playing with this toy in 6 months... my guess is \"yes\" especially if they like Play Doh and\/or they like one of the Disney Princesses that is included.<br \/><br \/>- No batteries, lights, or music.. which means that your child can sit and have some silent play!<br \/><br \/>- Seems to be pretty durable - I will update this review if we have any problems.<br \/><br \/>- Cleans up easily - Play Doh is not as messy as you may remember.<br \/><br \/>Final Verdict - The Play Doh Disney Prettiest Princess Castle may be the perfect gift for a child that loves the Disney Princesses. This one is an easy recommendation for me.<br \/><br \/>5 Stars",

  "text":"I was so surprised to find this.  Joni has released 3 live collections in her cannon, but this and a few others catch her in her innocence, vulnerable in front of a small audience, not counting those  listening live on the radio.  Her conversation between songs shows an open and honest young woman, months after the release of her first album and before she recorded studio versions of some of her best known works.  Both Sides Now, The Circle Game etc.  The other thing that is showcased is her ability with the guitar.....a six string!  Her voice, not as affected by her cigarette habit at this point, is at once lifting and light then down to the lower ranges which makes her sound older than she was at the time.  The liner notes read that she wrote Both Sides Now in 1966.  When you think about the lyrics, it's comparable to Dylan's Blowin' In The Wind at the same age.<br \/><br \/>OK, technical quality.  Fair.  The disc starts out in mid song.  It fades out at another song only to come back in applause.  BUT the performance itself trumps those trifles, even the uneven volume of the songs.  This is valuable for it's historicity and the facet that it is just Joni and her guitar.  That was all she ever needed!",

I wasn't sure how the product would be in real life because I just kept imagining there is no way the swab won't fall off with use and cleaning.<br \/>But here are the great pros:<br \/>1) You get 4 swabs with 8 different ends that instantly multiplies how, where, and when you can use compared to the regular cotton swab. Used on the body, like ears, eyebrows, nails, etc. or even to clean tight spots in the kitchen, car, or keyboard!<br \/>2) You can disinfect them! Which is the best part! Cotton swabs are packed together and you are not sterile by any means. These can be disinfected because they seemingly withstand temperatures up to 230 C or 446 F. So I can easily boil them after use, apply alcohol, or use a multitude of methods to disinfect them safely.<br \/>3) Reusable over and over again<br \/>4) Highly effective. I have persistent unresolvable ear itching that started years ago because of the constant use of earplugs, and my dermatologist and I have tried all sorts of meds to resolve it to no avail. I use cotton swabs several times a day, and to me, they have never been entirely helpful. I have not tried all the tips for all the other things they could do, but I can say that for the hairy tip that it's the very best tool I have ever used that helped me with the itching. It does a perfect job, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br \/>They're very light, compact, come in a great case, super easy to clean and disinfect, if needed, highly effective, and will save money and storage space!",

  "text":"8 of my family members (half of whom were wrestlers) watched this yesterday (Christmas Day).  Everyone was glued to the end.  The video gets inside the most successful high school wrestling program in history, showing clips from practices, matches, training camps, and even the local youth wrestling program headed by the same head coach.  It is shot like a mainstream sports documentary, so it's gripping even to people who don't like wrestling.  This documentary helps viewers understand why good wrestlers train twice a day (almost) every day and then go without food or water for 24 hours prior to each match: Not for money or a better future, but simply to win.  More than anything else, this video conveys the internal drive that makes dedicated wrestlers push themselves further than most people consider reasonable or logical.<br \/><br \/>From a wrestler's perspective: As a former wrestler who has \"normal workouts\" at the gym, this video made me remember what it felt like to be truly hungry for victory.  It made me think about the 2 mile run I had earlier in the day and wonder how I'd gotten so soft over the years.  It drove me to get back on the mat, where I spent some time this morning and remembered, \"this is A LOT harder than running.\"  I highly recommend this documentary if you're a former wrestler who wants the internal drive to get back into the condition you were once in, or if you just want to see a well-shot documentary about a group of guys who work very hard and whose success has been nothing short of historical.<br \/><br \/>Availability: This item is unavailable on Amazon at the time this review was written.

  "text":"You are greeted by an electric hum, the supposed sound of Johnny Greenwood; Radiohead's resident gifted multi instrumentalist\/ weird noise maker, plugging in his guitar on the first day of the bands two week recording session for their sixth full length lp Hail to the Thief. For 56 minutes you are dragged away to a land of jangling guitars, electronic hums and the bittersweet croons of vocalist Thom Yorke. Ranging from the sonic melancholy of \"Where I End and You Begin\" to the chugging bass and tingling guitars of \"There There\" \"Hail to the Thief\" takes the listener deep into a lush soundscape of psuedo-break beat drums, haunting vocals and weeping electronics. Although the band admits the current bad blood of politics  lingering in the global air influenced the recording, they deny the title itself comes from a popular phrase describing the \"sweeping\" victory of George W Bush in the 2000 presidential elections, \"If the motivation for naming our album had been solely based on the U.S election, I'd find that to be pretty shallow.\" Yorke explains, \"To me it's about forces that aren't necessarily human, forces that are creating in this climate of fear. While making this record, I became obsessed with how certain people are able to inflict this incredible pain on others while believing they're doing the right thing. They're taking people's souls before their even dead. I was just overcome with all this fear and darkness. And that fear is the `Thief'.\" The `fear', of which Yorke speaks manifests itself quite clearly, in fact,\"Hail to the Thief\" is chock full of that good `ole satirical doom we have all come to love and except from Yorke and company. Sound wise, the album is a leap back to the more formal math rock format of Ok Computer, still, the album is still shrouded in the electronic blips and moody synthesizers that dominated of the band's twin 2000 releases Kid A and Amnesiac. Yorke attributes this mainly to the band learning how to play electronic material live. \"It was the tension between what's human and what's coming from the machines. That was the stuff we were getting into.\".  At times the instruments on \"Hail to the Thief\" seem to be dueling with one another, friction creating static, static creating a sonically charged wall of sound that sparks the senses. \"Hail to the Thief\" possesses a kind of raw energy and sarcastic anger that we haven't seen from Radiohead in years, and no one is arguing that it is back. \"Hail to the Thief\" opens with the track \"2+2=5\", a title ripped straight from the pages of George Orwell's 1984. Yorke sings in a sugary falsetto, \"It's the devils way now, there is no way out\" moments later he transmogrifies into a tea drinking English Jello Biafra screaming, \"Because you have not been paying attention!\". \"Hail to the Thief\" plays out like a tectonic plate on speed, rapidly switching from one thought to the next, one sound eaten by another. Drummer Phil Selway's beats sound as if they have been carefully arranged, ripped to shreds, then looped back together again and  Yorke's lyrics are fragmented. He never fully states his point, he only implies that it exists, leaving the listener to decide for themselves what the meaning is. The song \"Myxomatosis\" (the european virus created to dwindle the swelling rabbit population in the 1950's)  is narrated by a \"Mongrel cat holding half a head\" who speaks of the distortions of the media amidst industrial synthesizers and pulsing drums. In the song \"Sit down, stand up\" Yorke barks nonsense orders, then, accompanied by a drum machine, proceeds to repeats the phrase \"and the raindrops\" 46 times. \"I just liked the way it sounded.\" is his explanation.<br \/> Dripping with, delicious ambiguity, haunting melodies,  schizophrenic love songs, and warm feedback Radiohead's \"Hail to the Thief\" is the grayish light cutting through all the emo-rock-rap-bubble-gum-poppy-punk noise that seems to have crowded the music industry. A complex album with layers upon layers of sound and meaning, \"Hail to the Thief\" may take a few listens before any deeper meaning can be pulled from it's jumbled content. This, however, is what makes it such a spectacular album. It's meanings can change to suit the listener. We are all allowed to take away what is pertinent to our own lives. The obscurity of the material leaves it wide open for interruption. So maybe we still don't completely understand it, but, by God, we appreciate it.",

  "text":"I saw a co-worker using a self-massager at her desk and she let me try it. I was hooked. I looked at the brands available on Amazon, and thought I'd give the Gideon a try because of the positive reviews, and because it came in purple. The Amazon box it came in was about 4x the size of the product box, so I was a little surprised when I opened it and found out it came in three pieces and needed minor assembly. It took less than 30 seconds to snap together, but did require some muscle. So happy when I started using it. Came with a little instruction booklet that had picture examples of how to use. Really feels good to work the back and feet for a couple of minutes every so often as I watch TV. I keep it by the couch so I can do short massages during commercial breaks or sports time outs. Extremely durable, super strong plastic. Really have enjoyed using it.",

I only wish I'd purchased it 5 mice ago and stopped wasting Amazon's time and returns. Some manufacturers inaccurately describe\/measure their mice width.

  "text":"Sarah Sundin is one of my favorite authors. I have loved every single one of her books, so you could say I was excited for her latest release, The Sea Before Us. It did not disappoint. It reiterates Sundin as one of the masters of World War II historical fiction.<br \/><br \/> With every book of hers, I'm astounded by the amount of research that must go into each one! The attention to detail, the historical facts... wow! I definitely feel completely immersed in the time period while reading her books. And I learn so much interesting and compelling bits of history too. It was so fascinating learning some of what went into preparing for D-Day. It took so much planning and there were so many opportunities for something to go wrong, something that could've changed the outcome.<br \/><br \/> The way Sundin weaves a brilliant message of faith in with all the history and romance is so amazing and one of my favorite aspects of her books. And what great messages they are in this novel! There are quite a few but the one that stuck out to me the most was the reminder to just be yourself. Don't change yourself to impress someone else or to make them like you. God made you uniquely you, so embrace that.<br \/><br \/> I highly, highly recommend this book and can't wait for the next one to find out more about the Paxton brothers!<br \/><br \/> I received a copy of the book from the publisher via NetGalley and voluntarily reviewed it.

  "text":"Magical...  This book is based on old Russian fairytales which are sprinkled through the book as told by Dunya, the old nurse and grandmother figure of this story.  She raised Marina, daughter of the&#34;swan-maiden&#34; that bewitched Ivan I into marrying him.  Even though it is a hard winter, Marina wants a daughter like her mother, one who could tame animals and see the future.  Marina dies giving birth to Vasya (short for Vailisa), who has green eyes like the sea and has the second sight (can see the magical world).  Wild and free-spirited, Vasya is always outdoors and makes friends with the guardians of the forest.  When her father remarries a devout Christian woman named Anna and a new priest named Konstantin arrives in the village, the guardians and the old ways are pushed aside and fear of angering God causes an imbalance in the world.  A demon known as the Bear, master of nightmares, awakens and feeds on the people's fear and awakens the dead.  The demon's brother and master, Frost\/Death, struggles to control him.  Vasya is warned in dreams similar to the fairytales told by Dunya about what is happening.  Anna and Konstantin help spread the fear among the village that Vasya is a witch and that Vasya's sin and witchcraft is causing their suffering.  As the &#34;real&#34; world collides with the magical world, Vasya must use all her bravery and magic she can find within herself to try and save her village, no matter what the cost.<br \/><br \/>There was so many fairytales in this book that I was trying to remember and figure out how they may be related to what was going on currently in the story that it almost seemed like a mystery book, trying to fit all the clues together.  This book was beautifully written.  I could feel the cold and the fear and the hopelessness and panic that Vasya felt having no control in the decisions that shaped her life and her future:<br \/><br \/>\u201cWhy are you frightened, Vasilisa Petrovna?\u201d \u201cDo not you know, Batyushka?\u201d she said. Her laugh was soft and desperate. \u201cYou were frightened when they sent you here. You felt the forest closing about you like a fist; I could see it in your eyes. But you may leave if you will. There is a whole wide world waiting for a man of God, and already you have drunk the water of Tsargrad and seen the sun on the sea. While I\u00a0\u2026\u201d He could see the panic rising in her again, and so he strode forward and seized her arm. \u201cHush,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not be a fool; you are making yourself frightened.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cYou are right,\u201d she said. \u201cI am foolish. I was born for a cage, after all: convent or house, what else is there?\u201d \u201cYou are a woman,\u201d said Konstantin. He was still holding her arm; she stepped back and he let her go. \u201cYou will accept it in time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be happy.\u201d<br \/><br \/>This is supposed to be the first book in a series so I am looking forward to book 2-- it can't be released soon enough.<br \/><br \/>I gave this book 5 out of 5 stars on Goodreads.<br \/><br \/>I received an advanced readers copy of this book from Netgalley for review consideration.",

He knows there's more to the story than simple spite. When they get partnered for Dancing With Wishful, he finally gets the chance to act on the spark he's felt since she moved home. But getting past her regrets just might be the biggest challenge he's ever faced.<br \/><br \/>As the competition heats up, so do the feelings between them.

Still even if you can't figure out what the moves mean...  Just reading the book is rather interesting, also its 2 books in 1...  The price is rather affordable for just about anyone...  The writing style is rather easy to follow and at times give the reader insight into what his thoughts were...  I know many say he had ties to certain people and all this...  This book is about his chess and mostly what he did at the chess board...  The name Alekhine Defense I think is sorta confusing since not many if any of those games are in this book...  From name you would think that he played it lot more often than he actually did...  So do not get this book thinking your gonna learn that defense :)...  Granted the cover isnt the best color, nor is the picture the best...  Still its not a bad book to leave on your coffee table or something...  Ive not read my book in a while at all...  Yet I see it at least once a day, just one of those classic books...  Im not really sure this book will help your game to be honest...  Still just reading his words I find rather interesting...  Many remember him as beating the one who many still think was best ever...  Sadly he died before giving Capablanca a rematch, so people speculate he would of lost and got lucky...  Also I think Alekhine was the one that brought preparation to new levels in chess...  So I guess many could hate him for that reason...  Just think of this book as part of history...  If you wish to read and learn a bit and feel what it was like...  That choice is up to you...",

  "text":"Worked great for freshies. Took a little longer to absorb fragrance. Yes they smell when you get them. But you have to air them out a week or so. I used large baking tins and put parchment paper in bottom. I spread them out as much as possible so they would air out quicker. I started with one tin & ended up with 3. I mixed them around each day to air them out quicker. I think people don't take this step into consideration & don't realize it will have to be done. Freshies aren't a quick item to make. If you are going to make a lot. You need to take that step into consideration and always have a new batch airing out as you are soaking aroma beads. If not. You will be disappointed when you are done making your batches of Freshies & need to order more beads & will have to wait a week before you can soak them. Get a routine going. Understand that aroma beads come to you smelling funny. But the DO air out if you take the right steps & have patience. These worked fine for my Freshies. I was just making them for family but now I have requests. I will also add that you need to take into consideration that instructions online are suggestions. You will have to do several test runs to figure out your best oven temp & time to get the perfect freshie. Watch them closely. Use tips for release spray etc. Unless you are absolutely positive you know what you are doing. Keep in mind your first several batches if not first order of beads may be your test products. So go ahead & order extra or be patient. I've done all kinds of crafts etc. Freshies are not a fast product. They weren't that easy to perfect either. I'm still learning. Buy quality everything & research & join grouos. Then you won't be disappointed.",

  "text":"I love cover versions of big hits. Sometimes they are very tastefully performed and at other times they are a quick cash-in attempt. This cover falls in the former category, thankfully.<br \/><br \/>I won't pretend to be familiar with Vanilla. I was never that big into 80's rock, American or European either one. I found this song while browsing the Internet one day. It was a pretty crummy quality video that appeared to be VHS quality.<br \/><br \/>A quick look on Amazon found one for sale. I have never seen a 45rpm that was 12\" before. The sound quality of the pressing is amazing.<br \/><br \/>If you love the Zager and Evans' hit version, buy this one also and get a fresh, interesting perspective on the song you've never heard before.",

  "text":"I've never really thought that Bigfoot, or Sasquatch as it's sometimes called, is anything more than a myth fueled by a series of clever (or not-so-clever) hoaxes. And so I was more than a little skeptical when I began reading Kelly Milner Halls' latest book, In Search of Sasquatch (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011). I knew Halls to be a terrifically talented and prolific writer of nonfiction books for young people (Saving the Baghdad Zoo, Mysteries of the Mummy Kids, and Tales of the Cryptids are some of her better-known books)--but Sasquatch? Really?<br \/><br \/>Leave it to Halls to make you think just a little differently about your worldview. After reading In Search of Sasquatch, I can't say that I'm packing to go on a Sasquatch search expedition, but I'm willing to entertain the notion that it may very well exist.<br \/><br \/>The many people Halls has interviewed for the book include an anthropologist, a linguistic expert, a biologist, and several people who claim to have sighted Sasquatch. While acknowledging that Sasquatch hoaxes abound, she bolsters her argument for the possible existence the mysterious creature by example: for centuries, paleontologists believed that the coelacanth was a long-extinct prehistoric fish--until a living coelacanth was discovered in 1938. Similarly, the giant squid was a thing of Greek legend--until it was discovered in 2004.<br \/><br \/>Her text is accompanied by gorgeous illustrations, additional resources, a glossary, and an extensive bibliography and source notes. Kids who are drawn to the weird and wonderful will love this book. So will adults.",

To me this is so much more valuable than the items that came in the box, we spend our hard earned money on things that we enjoy and it really helps to know that a brand stands behind their products and their customers.

  "text":"This book picks up where Velvet Devil left off. Camila has confessed to Isaak that she gave birth to a baby girl five and a half years previous and he's the father. She doesn't willingly confess this to him but the jig is up because Isaak knows everything already, after his mother confessed to having hired a private investigator to look into Camila's past and it's determined that her sister has only given birth to two boys, no mention of a little girl. He puts things together and figures out that the niece she claims her sister has is in fact her daughter. He thinks that the girl is the result of a tryst with Maxim, his cousin; but Camila confesses to him that that's not the case. She is the result of their one night stand the night her world was turned upside down and the result of which put her into the witness protection program. The cops are at the door because they've discovered that Camila is being held at Isaak's mansion. Camila decides to walk away from Isaak and go back into the witness protection program. She protects Isaak by telling the authorities that she was with Isaak of her own free will and doesn't want any charges filed against him. She's back in the program and is at a safe house but will soon be moved because the Vorobev clan is on the move in the states and she's no longer safe. She doesn't know which Vorobev is after her, whether it's Isaak or Maxim. It is determined that it's Maxim, he won't ever give her up ever since she ended up married to Isaak and being whisked away by him on the day she was supposed to marry Maxim. In the meantime, Isaak pays her a visit one night at the safe house she's escaped to after leaving his home and going back into the witness protection program. All the feelings she has for him come to the forefront. He tells her that he's there for information. Information about his daughter, but it's all pretense because he already has her tucked away at his house  in New York, but he has yet to see her or interact with her. Things get heated between the two of them and after a quicky he starts to leave; on the way out he asks her if she knows where she's being moved to. She tells him no, but that he probably already knows, to which he confesses that he doesn't. So, she tells him that she guesses that'll be the last time she sees him and he says yes. He starts going out the window when he stops and gives her a scrap of paper. She asks what is it and he tells her a lifeline. He goes out the window, disappears from sight and also out of her life. She looks at the piece of paper and realizes that it has just a phone number written on it. She keeps it. The safe house she's in is run by a married couple that she grows to care for. Two days later she's downstairs drinking coffee when she sees Eric, her original handler with the Witness Protection Agency, pull up to the house. She races out to greet him and asks what is he doing there, that they have a few more days before her move to a more permanent location. He tells her that Andrew, her new handler will be by tonight to prep her for her move. She starts saying that they still have a few days left before the move. He cuts her off, telling her no that the timeliness has moved up because the Vorobevs are showing activity there in New York. She starts to protest and before she can finish bullets start flying through the air. Eric grabs Camila and they run through the neighbors' yards escaping all the way to a convenience store which they duck into to regroup. Camila wonders out loud how they found her and she tells Eric that Isaak Vorobev visited her two nights ago; if he wanted to take her then he could've done so that  night therefore it's Maxim. Eric makes a confession as well. He thinks that there's a spy in the agency and he suspects that it's Andrew. He buys her a hoodie sweatshirt and tells her to wait there. He disappears and reappears with a white car that he hot wired with the intention of returning it when they are somewhere safe, but where could that be. He has no idea how to keep her safe. They drive a distance away and pull into a small cafe. Camila pulls out the number and calls it. Before long, Isaak pulls up in an understated black Audi at the small eatery that Eric has taken Camila to. He gets out of the car and leans against the passenger door and stared through the eatery's large window at Camila as she sat with Eric with a bowl of ice cream in front of her. Eric goes to the counter to pay the bill and Camila walks outside heading straight for Isaak. She greets him and says that he gave her the number and she called it. So he asks her why did she call. It takes her a while to answer but she finally answers after surveying the area. She explains that the safe house was attacked. He asks her if it was his cousin, Maxim.  She says that she doesn't know who else it would be. He wants to know how Maxim even knew where she was. She tells him that he apparently found her and he confesses to her that he had her followed by some of his men the minute she left from his house to go into the program. She tells him that was a violation of her privacy. He tells her he needed to keep an eye on her and this situation proves his point. She retorts back that he was never going to allow her to disappear in the system, was he. He stays silent. Instead he turns to Camila and tells her to say her goodbyes that she's under his protection now. She turns to Eric to tell him goodbye, he tells her that he received a phone call and the couple who were running the safe house were okay. That the male was shot and taken into surgery immediately and he's now in stable condition. Camila tell him thank you and not to worry. Eric kisses her on the forehead and tells her to go on.Then she gets into the passenger seat. Isaak speaks with Eric, telling him that he failed to protect her. Eric confesses that he already knows that and he tells Isaak that he doesn't want Camila hurt, physically or mentally. Isaak agrees with him and basically says he wants the same thing as well. Isaak and Camila get on the road heading towards Isaak's New York house. It's mostly silent all the way there. They arrive at his mansion and he gives her directions to the room that's hers. He also tells her he expects her for dinner that night and to wear something nice.  She heads upstairs to find her room. Once she's out of hearing range, Isaak's right hand man and little brother, Bogdan, informs him that Maxim has sent a message but it's not for him, it's for Camila. Also, what they don't know is that Camila has doubled back around and hears bits and pieces of their conversation. Isaak wonders how his brother knows that Camila is with him. There's a leak somewhere in the chain. The only person who knows that Camila is with him is Eric so he tells Bogdan to put some eyes on Eric and let him know everything he's doing. Camila dresses in a short sexy dress that she hopes will persuade Isaak to give her the message Maxim sent for her. She wants closure from the relationship she had with Maxim because she never got the chance to end it with him. She was getting ready to marry him, albeit it was all based on lies that he told her. Isaak finally tells her that Maxim wants to talk to her, but he refuses to allow this. Camila can't keep her hands,and other body parts, off of Isaak. No other man has caused this rush of feelings in her before, it's like she can't be around him without touching him. Camila is in the dark about the fact that Isaak has kidnapped her daughter, their daughter,  Jo from her sister's house and is hiding her at his New York mansion. The very mansion she's in right now. After several arguments,  Isaak finally relents and agrees to finally allow her to talk with Maxim.  She's going to have a face to face conversation with him. Maxim arrives at Isaak's house and he's checked for weapons before he's allowed within the fence of the mansion. Isaak goes to meet him and has Bogdan frisk him as well. Once he's cleared, Isaak escorts him to a one room shed that is normally used to hold prisoner and rarely does one walk out of there unharmed. He has a brief talk with Maxim who insists that he knows what lies in Camila's heart and that she loves him and will want to leave with him. He was with her for two years wooing her, although also lying to her about who he was, to her he was Alex. Camila dresses in light blue form fitting sun dress, which annoys Isaak to no end becausehe notices that she's put quite an effort into her appearance for Maxim. He locks her in the room with Maxim so they could talk. At first the conversation is stilted and neither knows what to say. Then she corners him about all the lies he told her, pretending to be Alex just to get close to her. He confesses that he did it to take something important away from his cousin to get back at him for what his father did to his, killing him. Then he goes on to explain that after a while he got to know her and fell in love with her. He keeps insisting that she knew Isaak before the night that he attacked the restaurant. She tells him, no that that was the first time she had met Isaak. She explains that he saved her from a bad date and that's how the met.She then confesses to him that she has a daughter and that it is Isaak's. Maxim tells her that he knows that already and that he wants her to come with him. That he could protect her and her daughter from Isaak. Also that Isaak said that she would be free to go if she chose to go with him. He also lets it slip that Isaak has already got Jo in his possession. Then Isaak barges into the room telling them that time is up and if she wants to go with Maxim, she's free to go.Here is where I'll leave you and you'll have to get the book to find out what happens next. I'll just say that things will definitely heat up and you'll get to find out who she chooses to be with. You'll also find out if there are more family secrets that come to light within the Vorobev family. Will she find out her daughter is in the same house as she is and if there is a chance for a happily ever after for her and her daughter. It really is a well written storyline that will keep you hooked until the very end.  A truly moving mafia romance that's definitely worth the price of admission!!.<br \/><br \/>I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",

This was my first Trisha Yearwood album and definitely not the last, to start out at this album I made the right choice, another standout album of Trisha's is &quot;EveryBody Knows&quot;.  I just listened to her &quot;Inside Out&quot; album and I can't wait to buy that one.

  "text":"This book may be the one of the most important book you ever read. Not because it makes you feel good, but because it makes you feel sick. Sick of the lies and hypocrisy of the-powers-that-be. But once you overcome your emotions, it makes you understand the world we live in and how our conception of it has been systematically manufactured and why, in our supposedly \"free\" society (make sure you also read appendice 4).<br \/><br \/>Thus, ultimately, it makes you understand the laws-of-nature that forever seem to determine fates of nations. Power. It and it alone, determines who is \"good\" and who is \"bad\" regardless of type governance (unfortunately). It's perfectly simple. As Karl Rove once stated:<br \/><br \/>\"We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality - judiciously, as you will - we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors... and you, all of you, will be left just to study what we do.\"''<br \/><br \/>This book is one very, very important study in reality that we are only \"left to study\". This book also (unintentionally but strongly) relates to \"Manufacturing Consent by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky\", which answers the question why you never see anything about these events in our \"free\" media (also a highly recommended read).<br \/><br \/>There is one hope for the mankind, in words of Martin Luther King: \"The moral arc of the universe is long but it bends toward justice\". In the end justice is stronger than power of all the governments. This book is only one small but impressive bend towards justice, no matter how many generations may still have to pass before all the lies still out there about WW2 have been debunked.

  "text":"The only contact lens solution I will use. I wear gas permeable (hard) lenses, and this means that they have to be cleaned and reused for up to a year or more. All the gunk needs to be cleaned and disinfected every night, and this is the most hygenic system of doing so-peroxide is what has been used to clean cuts for years, because it kills bacteria and viruses on contact. This does the same thing.<br \/><br \/>If people leave negative reviews of this product, THEY ARE USING IT WRONG. The product has explicit instructions, and every eye doctor will give you an explanation of how to use it. The red top and multiple warnings on the bottle say DO NOT PUT DIRECTLY IN EYES. This means dump the solution in the case, put the contacts in, and let them sit overnight. 6 hours later (no less), the solution is neutralized by the metal disc at the bottom and the solution will no longer burn. Where most people screw up is that they take the bottle with the red top and rinse the lens. NOOOOO. Use regular saline if you insist on doing this.<br \/><br \/>This is the best solution to get all the gunk off your lenses. Nobody is free of gunk-we all have it. Lenses will come out of this stuff squeaky clean, and since the solution requires you to use the neutralizing case, it will come with a new case every time you buy new bottles of solution. This is good because it reminds you to toss the old ones which get gross (and in the case of this, the metal disc gets old and loses its neutralizing power). I highly recommend this stuff as an eye doctor-nothing better works, especially if you have eye allergies, sensitivities, etc.",

  "text":"With eldest siblings Marcia and Greg quickly approaching their respective heights of groovyness, ignoring the younger and less popular Brady's would have been too easy for the scripting department at this point in the 'Brady Bunch' series.<br \/><br \/>Instead many episodes in this 23-episode 1971-1972 season pointedly explore Cindy and Bobby's quest to fit in with their other family members. Both are encouraged to like themselves for being who they are instead of trying to become somebody else. You cannot have other people like you unless you do not first like yourself.<br \/><br \/>In the 3-part Grand Canyon adventure opening this season, Bobby and Cindy become lost from their family on a camping trip.  They meet up with Jimmy, a young Indian (Michael Campo). Jimmy is also running away from his family because he feels isolated by his grandfather's expectations. In return for helping them get safely back to Camp Brady, Jimmy receives food from Bobby and Cindy. All of these kids panic when they are discovered, but all ends well for everybody.<br \/><br \/>\"In Big Little Man\" Bobby embarks on a quest to become physically bigger. When this does not work with the speed which he had originally preferred, Bobby sets out to become a mental giant instead. \"Mr. Brady\" himself---Robert Reed---directs this episode.<br \/><br \/>Finally \"Cindy Brady, Lady\" shows Bobby having a friend of his play `secret admirer' to his forlorn sister. Cindy is upset at having to be the youngest sibling in the family.  Bobby's action is really sweet specifically because I don't know of many brothers (including my own) who actually would think of doing this. Then again, it could be Bobby's empathy from his own age issues.<br \/><br \/>We also continue dealing with Jan's ongoing psychological issues mentioned during the previous seasons.<br \/><br \/>Jan is trying out for pom pom girl (\"Her Sisters Shadow\") so that her teachers will stop comparing her to `Marcia..Marcia..Marcia'. Even though Jan fails to be picked, it shows her determination to exercise an `independent streak' when being a copy-cat of Marcia would have been so much easier. Anybody can relate to always being compared to somebody whom you are not.<br \/><br \/>Jan then learns that real beauty is inside a person when she meets her Aunt Jenny (Imogene Coco) in \"Jan's Aunt Jenny\". Because they had looked a lot alike in her childhood photographs, Jan is worried that she will look just like Aunt Jenny now does when she is older. Yet talking with Aunt Jenny subsequently gives Jan a new perspective---somebody else knows about the issues she is now going through. Coco was a really big star so Paramount's ability to snag her for a guest appearance demonstrates the clout which this series had gained.<br \/><br \/>The Brady Bunch again proves why it sticks in the American psyche with this season. Many episodes delivered memorable social statements on tolerance, individuality, and identity without nagging to their audience.",

The CD itself gives a great  'fans' selection of Jackie Trent and Tony Hatch numbers and Hatch alone instrumentals.

They offer practical ideas for being active (not just doing workouts), getting outdoors, eating healthier without dieting, overcoming the challenges to staying motivated, and addressing the underlying beliefs and emotions that get in the way of success.<br \/><br \/>Becoming fit and healthy is less about following a prescribed set of guidelines and more about understanding what jazzes and motivates you and what holds you back, and Experience Life gets this.

  "text":"Being in the process of adding panels to cut reflections in my new bedroom conversion into a music studio, I've been trying out different types of materials. But from a purely economical perspective, foam paneling always seems to come out on top as an option. Given the chance to try these out, I thought I'd give them a go.<br \/><br \/>First off, they are exactly what you expect from this type of paneling. It is medium density foam that is laser cut, vacuumed, and packed tightly into thin packages. It takes a day or two to let them expand naturally, though you also have the option of soaking them in water, wringing them out, and then throwing them in your dryer.<br \/><br \/>I went for the former option since I had a few days before I was going to install them. Though to be honest, it took less time for these to expand to perfect condition than bass traps of a similar material that I purchased. And when they were ready, unlike the bass traps I got, there weren't any that were damaged or had flat sections.<br \/><br \/>The thickness on the pads is quite nice. For the same price, you could get the same amount or a bit more that are half as thick. But in that case, you really won't get the kind of frequency cutting that these panels will have.<br \/><br \/>Installing foam panels is always a challenge. I've tried double sided 3M tape but it never works. The secret is to use a spray-on adhesive. I use a light grade Loctite spray that--when sprayed on both the foam and the surface it is to be attached to--works like a charm. These are no different and will go up and stay up with adhesive spray.<br \/><br \/>All-in-all, I'm impressed with the quality of these, especially at the price. If you are looking for a good number of foam panels with decent thickness, definitely give these a shot.",

  "text":"I needed to get some screws that didn't have the sharp point at the end. I use these for all types of furniture pieces. They were the size I was looking for. They appear to be very durable. So I'm very satisfied. There's really not a whole lot you can say about screws. Other than they do what they were intended to do. So I'm happy.",

  "text":"Having been a loyal Flower Kings fan since the 90's, I have branched out and to own everything by Roine Stolt. What I never knew was all of the undiscovered talent from the other band members. After seeing this very hard to find CD by Tomas I just had to purchase it. It is like nothing else he has done before. I can hear similarities to some of Rick Wakeman and Vangelis. This might be considered somewhere along the lines of new age music, but it really is in a class all by itself. Music for Heaven! Heavenly music! It makes one feel at peace and is relaxing without putting you to sleep. It has it's highs and lows and is not stagnant. It simply blew me away. I would recommend getting it before it is gone as it is out of print. Thank you Tomas for making music like this. A devoted TFK fan!",

  "text":"The fire pit is even better than advertised. This is one of those times the reviews were spot on. It\u2019s small and easily portable for camping, yet sturdy and strong so you\u2019re comfortable it will contain your fire. Highly recommend if you are a primitive camper or just like to have a fire in your yard but don\u2019t want to build a permanent fire pit.",

  "text":"Well, I love My Morning Jacket. From the first time I discovered them, about four months ago on iTunes, I have been hooked. I mean it's just something about the sound and the lead singers voice- it's magical. I'm a big Neil Young and Bob Dylan fan and this takes me to a updated version of that form. They are touring with Pearl Jam, so if you haven't heard of them many people will soon. I don't think the new material from the album Z is all that good, but At Dawn is excellent. Some favorite tracks are Hopefully, The Way That He Sings, Bermuda Highway and At Dawn. Do yourself a HUGE favor if you like slower rock songs with a psycadelic (spelling?) feel then you will love this band.",

  "text":"\"Chronicles\" is oen of the very few actual conservative publications in the United States, unlike all those imperialist\/establishment publications like \"National Review\" (which lost whatever conservative credentials it had left when they fired Joe Sobran in the early 90s) and the noxious \"Weekly Standard.\"  \"Chronicles\" is concerned with culture, with faith, and literature, with politics and society from an American nationalist perspective that is urbane, informed and respectful - no ignorant war-mongering about \"freedom fries\" and \"old Europe\" here! It embraces and celebrates our Western cultural roots and our shared sense of place and civilization, without falling into the trap of cheap ethnocentrism. The writing is outstanding - Tom Fleming, Clyde Wilson, Paul Gottfried, the late Sam Francis, and so many others.  It is the best value in terms of price and high quality content in an American magazine of ideas today.",

The stick and pads have good feel to them. The only dislike is the sticks seem just a little small. Nothing a $4.00 kit cant fix. I highly recommend this controller. Especially after comparing it to the new glap controller.  This 1 is way way better.  All around just better.",
