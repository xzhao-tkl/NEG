# Neuron Empricial Gradient (NEG)

This repository contains the official implementation for the ACL 2025 paper:

**Neuron Empirical Gradient: Discovering and Quantifying Neurons Global Linear Controllability**

## Overview

This project introduces a novel method to empirically measure and analyze the global linear controllability of individual neurons in neural networks. Our approach provides new insights into neuron-level interpretability and intervention.

## Features

- Implementation of the Neuron Empirical Gradient (NEG) method.
- Tools for discovering and quantifying neuron controllability.
- Scripts for reproducing experiments and results from the paper.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xzhao-tkl/NEG.git
    cd NEG
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run experiments:**
    See the `examples/` directory and the instructions in each folders for details.
